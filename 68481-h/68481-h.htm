  <h2 class='c004'>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This work is translated from a more voluminous
one in Dutch, written by Madame
de Cambon, professedly for the instruction of
young people.</p>

<p class='c006'>The author has judiciously interspersed little
introductory hints relative to natural philosophy;
which, while they tend to awaken
curiosity, lead to reflections calculated to expand
the heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>Indeed any instruction which has not evidently
this tendency, will be found not only
useless but pernicious; if it be allowed that a
smattering of knowledge can never compensate
for narrowing the heart by introducing
vanity. And as it is much easier to dissipate
ignorance than root out that degree of selfishness,
which an endeavour to supplant others
generally inspires, emulation should very cautiously
be excited. On this account deviations,
from the original were unavoidable;
besides the editor apprehended that affectation
rather than virtue may be produced by
endeavouring, through a mistaken zeal, to
bring the mind forward prematurely, as in
all probability it will seldom afterwards reach
that degree of strength which it might have
acquired by gradual improvement. In short,
the whole has been abridged, and <i>material</i>
alterations made, to render it more extensively
useful; some sentiments and incidents
are thrown out, and others added, which
were naturally suggested by the subjects: it
would be needless to point out the alterations
that have been made; they were, in the editor’s
opinion, necessary. Productions intended for
the instruction of youth, without aiming at
the graces of higher compositions, should be
as free from errors as possible; but above all,
no narrow prejudices should be retained to
cramp the understanding, or make it submit
to any other authority than that of reason.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER I.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William D——</span> <i>to his</i> <span class='sc'>Mother</span>:</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>You desired me to write to you,
my dear mother. What a comfort it
is to be able to converse with you in
this way, now I am at such a distance,
and cannot see you!</p>

<p class='c006'>I did not find the journey fatiguing;
I was not sea-sick—but I was sorrowful—very
sorrowful, I assure you. You
will say that I am childish, when I tell
you, that, during the voyage, as often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>as I thought of the last kiss you gave me,
I could scarcely restrain my tears, or
mention your name without sobbing.
I hid myself in a corner of the cabin,
that I might weep freely without being
seen: I was not ashamed of it; yet as
the captain endeavoured to amuse me, I
did not wish him to know that I was so
very unhappy. Besides, my dear mother,
my tears will not flow when any
one looks at me;—but I will have done.
I know you love me, and I would not
willingly grieve you. My heart is
lighter.</p>

<p class='c006'>What a great city this is! and how
full the streets are of people! The large
towns in Holland are nothing to it.
Every thing pleases me; but I find not
here my dear mother: I cannot run
hastily home to tell her all I have seen,
and I do not half enjoy the fine sights.</p>

<p class='c006'>You praised Lady Grandison; indeed
she is so good-natured every one must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>love her, as soon as they see her face.
How she pressed me in her arms when I
arrived—just as you do, when you are
pleased with me. And Sir Charles
Grandison, oh! I cannot tell you what
a worthy man he seems to be: he is so
tender-hearted. My father was like him,
I dare say; yes, he certainly was, for
you have often told me that he was a
good man. Ah! had I yet that father,
how happy should I be: I would love
and obey him, as young Charles obeys
his father; and I should not love you
less. God, you have frequently said, is
now in a peculiar manner my father. I
pray every night to him, with more
earnestness than ever, to bless my mother,
my only parent, and to enable me to be
a comfort to her. Now farewel, my
dear mother, think often of me, and
love your own</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER II.<br /> <span class='large'><i>Mrs.</i> D—— <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>William</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Your letter afforded me the most
solid satisfaction, my dear son; while
I felt for you, the sorrow, you so well
described, drew you still closer to my
heart. Your warm manner of expressing
your filial affection pleased me, as it
convinced me, that you have a feeling
heart. A son who could leave an indulgent
mother, without experiencing
similar emotions, will never love God,
or do good to his fellow-creatures; he
will live for himself alone, and gradually
lose the dignity of his nature. But dry
up your tears; immoderate sorrow is a
sign of weakness, and will prevent your
improvement, the principal end of life.
We must arm ourselves with courage to
ward off the casualties that in this uncertain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>state we are exposed to; the happiest
situations are not exempt from
them; heaven sends pain and sorrow to
teach us virtue, and not merely to afflict
us. When you lament that we are separated,
think with what pleasure we
shall meet again; and how eagerly my
eyes will run over your whole person,
and my ears be on the catch to weigh
your words: that I may trace your improvement,
and love you still more.—And
this love would be a comfort to
my age, I should not consider myself a
widow.—Yes, your father was virtuous;
resemble him; and console, in some degree,
your mother, by cultivating the
virtues which just begin to dawn in your
mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall write to each other often;
to write is the same as to speak. You
are now rewarded for the diligent attention
you paid to my commands, though
at first it was an irksome task to learn to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>write; but had you neglected it, we
could not have converted when a vast
sea, or large tracts of land were between
us—then, indeed, I should have
been absent in the true sense of the word.
Now I can participate in all your pleasures:
be very particular in your account
of them; and remember to write as you
speak. A letter ought to be simple and
natural; regulate your thoughts, and let
your expressions appear easy and not
studied. Above all, strictly adhere to
truth; you violate it, when you use unmeaning
compliments, or permit affectionate
words to drop from your pen,
which are fabricated by the head for
selfish purposes, and do not flow from a
good heart. Take care always of your
spelling: it is a shameful thing for any
one to be ignorant of his native language.</p>

<p class='c006'>Present my best respects to Lady
Grandison.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER III.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to his</i> <span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A thousand thanks do I wish to
send you, my dear mother, for your
letter; I feel myself of some consequence
now you correspond with me.
Was I wrong, when I was proud of
your praises? I wished Lady Grandison
to know that I had been an obedient
son, and I gave her your letter to read.
What an excellent mother you have,
William, said she! you must obey all
her commands, and console her by acquiring
virtue. You must try to amuse
her by communicating your sentiments;
and do not forget to tell her of all your
amusements, your business, and even
the conversations which you listen to in
this family: and this attention will in
some degree make her happy. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Madam, said I, my mother has often
forbid me to mention any conversations
I heard, when I went with her to pay
a visit. William, she replied, you must
learn to make distinctions; conversations
are not to be repeated; but you may
confide every observation you make in
the bosom of a friend, except indeed the
secrets you have promised to keep, they
are sacred. A young person ought never
to promise to keep any secrets from
an indulgent parent, till their reason
enables them to govern themselves, and
they are no longer children.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh! how glad I was, for you know,
dear mother, that I am now fond of
writing. How much I shall have to
tell you of young Charles; yes, it is of
him, that I mean to speak the most.
You cannot think how much sense he
has, and how good he is; indeed I do
love him. We are almost always together,
for his cousin Edward, though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>is two years older, has not half his sense
and goodness. But Lady Grandison told
me yesterday, his education had been
neglected, so I pity him; yet cannot
love him as I love Charles and Emilia.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'><i>Mrs.</i> D—— <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>William</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I wish you happy, my son, and
rejoice that you have chosen such a
friend as Charles. Yet, while you admire
your friend, do not hate Edward;
remark his faults only to avoid them.
He is really an object that should excite
your compassion, while you thank God
for having placed you in a different situation.
You had the advantage of receiving
early instruction, and was not
allowed to contract any bad habits. Sir
Charles paid the same diligent attention
to cultivate your new friend’s mind, and
Dr. Bartlett assisted: but poor Edward
was suffered to run almost wild.</p>

<p class='c006'>You have seen in the little garden I
have, that weeds grow quickly; and
would soon choke the vegetables and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>flowers, if a careful hand did not pluck
them up by the roots.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lady Grandison praises you; do your
best to deserve her approbation, and you
shall ever be the beloved of my heart.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER V.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to his</i> <span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I enjoy here much pleasure; we
walk, we draw, we learn music; and we
sometimes go to the Play. But what
pleases me most, is a microscope, my
friend has. We see in it the most wonderful
things; every body ought to have
microscopes to know rightly what there
is in the world. We view the flies, the
spiders, &amp;c. I shall speak to you often
of them, I shall communicate our conversations
word for word. Dr. Bartlett,
who is with us every day, teaches us
many wonderful things. Yes, Mama,
your son shall be well furnished with
knowledge; but I must leave off writing,
for I am called. Go then away,
letter, and tell my dear mother how
much I love her; and assure her that I
shall be always her dutiful son.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to his</i> <span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>To-morrow we go to the country-seat—what pleasure I shall have
there! Charles has packed up a great
many books to take with him; for we
are both fond of reading. Our drawings
and our pencils are not forgotten.
Charles has drawn some landscapes from
nature; and I will try to do a view of
the house, and send it to you. I enclose
you one of the town habitation. You
must observe two windows on the left
side of the house, I will mark them,
your William sleeps in that room, pray
look at it.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are all glad to go to the country-seat,
except Edward, he is displeased.
I have been present at a conversation,
which interested me. I will repeat it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Do you know, said Emilia, that our
dear Dr. Bartlett goes with us into the
country? Yes, answered Charles, and I
am glad of it. So am not I, grumbled
Edward. And why? Because he is always
reproving me. The reproofs of
so wise a man as Dr. Bartlett are very
useful, and then he speaks in such a
mild voice, the very tone encourages
me to hope that I may correct the faults
he reproves: I am sorry but not hurt,
said Charles. I thought at least I should
be free for some time from learning that
miserable Latin, continued Edward;
but, no, we must write a theme every
day, I suppose. I hope so, said Charles,
and that will not be tiresome. But,
Edward, have you nothing to pack up?
I shall let the servants do that, answered
he. The servants will have enough
to do, said Emilia. Then they may go
an hour later to bed. Poor servants, replied
Emilia, they are tired and want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>sleep; besides, they must rise very early
in the morning; you could spare them
some trouble, and that would be a better
employment than tormenting your
dog. But he is my dog, snarled Edward.
Yes, said Emilia, but the servants
are not your servants nor mine.
I need not your lessons, Madam.—Charles
interrupted him, and took them
both by the hand, and, turning to Edward,
said, we have been taught from
our infancy to think attendance a proof
of weakness; and that we ought not to
give the meanest of our fellow-creatures
trouble when we can avoid it, if we desire
to be truly great. Give me the business
of the servant and you will oblige
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farewel, my dear mother, I will
write as soon as I arrive at the country-seat.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to his</i> <span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Here we are at the country-seat,
dear mother. What a fine house! what
a pretty garden! There are a number of
trees I never saw before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles has a little garden, which he
manages entirely himself. He plants
and sows seeds according to his own
mind. As soon as we were rested, he
ran to his garden, and what do you think
he did? he is certainly a good boy, he
gave half a guinea to the gardener, who
had taken care of it in his absence. The
man receives constant wages from his
father; but he has six children, and
Charles is compassionate. Surely it was
well done; yet Edward found fault. I
will tell you all; oh! I recollect something;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Lady Grandison bid me write
our conventions in the manner of a
dialogue, and not always to be using the
phrase, <i>he said</i> and <i>she said</i>. Edward
saw the gardener receive the half guinea,
and he ran to Charles.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c006'>Are you foolish, Charles, that you
give so much money to that man? My
uncle pays him very well for his work.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is true; but see how neat my
garden is, it deserves a reward. Besides,
he is a poor man, who has many
children; and I used to climb up his
knees when I was a child.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Very well; but I say again, he has
more than what belongs to him. Dare
you tell my uncle what you have
done?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, certainly. I hope never to do
any thing that I should be afraid to
mention to him. He sometimes gives
the gardener money himself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My uncle gives his own money, and
what you gave is not your own.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I beg your pardon; what I have given
to the gardener was my own; I received
it a few days before I left London as a
reward; and could I make a better use
of it? I did double business that I might
have some money to give away.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And could you not have bought something
with it; such as fire-works?
They would have afforded rare sport in
the country.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fire-works, and for what? Fire-works
are but for a moment; while the shoes
the poor man will buy for his children,
will keep them out of the wet a month
or two.</p>

<p class='c006'>EDWARD, (<i>laughing</i>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>And what good will it do you, if
their feet are dry?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If I do them good, it is enough; I
feel pleasure in assisting the poor, and
particularly that good-natured man who
was so kind to me when I was a helpless
babe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Edward said no more; he ran away
from us to torment a cat, which he had
seen lie sleeping on the grass.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>What do you think of all this? I,
for my part, was ashamed of Edward,
and love Charles more than ever. When
I am rich, should I ever be so, I will
give to the poor; it is such a pleasure
to make glad a person in distress.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Your last letter gave me inexpressible
pleasure, my son. I am pleased
with you for loving Charles, for loving
his virtues; but you must do more, let
your affection have an influence on your
conduct, and endeavour to copy the good
qualities you approve.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pleasure that was painted on the
gardener’s countenance found its way
quickly to the heart of Charles, and
made it glad; and this pleasure will be
continually renewed, when he meets the
smiling infants with the shoes on he
gave them. The momentary amusement
that the fire-works would have
afforded, is not to be compared to this
heart-felt satisfaction. The only way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to deserve affluence, and indeed the only
true pleasure it procures, is the enlarged
power of doing good.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lady Grandison has sent me another
of your drawings. I am glad to see you
so much improved: go forward in this
manner, dear William; should you be
deprived of your small fortune, painting
would be a respectable way of earning
an independance. At any rate it
will be an innocent source of amusement
which will keep you out of idleness
and bad company. Yes, idleness
leads to every vice; the exercise of the
fine arts is a good preservative of youth.
Take your pleasure, my son, fulfil your
duty, and write often to your affectionate
mother.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Ah, Mama! a great misfortune has
happened here. Edward has fallen
into the water, he is very ill. Lady
Grandison is indisposed, and we are
much afflicted. If he had not got help
quickly, he would certainly have been
drowned.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was yesterday afternoon; he had not
wrote his theme, and his uncle ordered
him to stay in his room to make it.
He is always disobedient; he was never
taught to obey when he was not in the
presence of those who had a right to
command him. He went down notwithstanding
what his uncle had said,
and came to us; but I must tell you
all.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>We were going to a farm-house, not
far off, to drink some warm milk. Edward
ran himself out of breath to overtake
us. Seeing him running, we waited
for him, thinking that he had obtained
leave to go with us. After we
had walked a little way together, we
met a boy with a wheel-barrow, on
which there was a barrel of vinegar.
He made us a bow. Soon after his
wheel-barrow was turned over, and the
vinegar barrel fell out on the ground.
The poor boy was in great distress, for
he was not able to lift the barrel on the
wheel-barrow again; and there was nobody
near him who could offer him
their assistance. Charles ran to him,
Come William, come Edward, said he,
let us help this little boy, we shall all
four be able to put the barrel in the
wheel-barrow. Are you foolish, cried
Edward? do you think I would demean
myself to such low work? There is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>meanness, replied Charles, in doing a
good action. Let us see, said I, we
three are strong enough, it is not very
heavy; in short, mama, we placed the
barrel on the barrow—while Edward
did nothing but sing, and call us fools.
The little boy was very much obliged to
us, and wheeled away.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fine young gentlemen, said Edward,
you will soon be able to wheel a vinegar
barrel. Very well, cousin, answered
Charles, laughing, then if my
vinegar barrel was to fall, I should
be very thankful to any person who
would help me up with it. Laugh
as you will, continued Edward, but
what would your father say, if he was
told what you have done? He would
commend Charles, said Emilia, my father
is good, he would have done just
the same himself. And I, said Edward,
am ashamed of this affair; what had
we to do with that poor boy? Oh! replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Charles, we must not only be serviceable
to others who have need of
assistance because it is our duty; but we
must do it to gratify humane feelings,
which, my father says, are in every good
heart. I should not have enjoyed the
treat we are going to have, if I had
left the boy vainly attempting to replace
his barrel. Besides, that very boy might
have it in his power, some time or other,
to assist us; but this is not a motive, a
good action is its own reward.</p>

<p class='c006'>We had not been many minutes in
the farm-house before Edward proposed
sailing in a small boat on a little river
near the house. Charles and Emilia refused,
saying, that he knew very well
that their father and Dr. Bartlett had
forbid them. But they will not know
any thing about it, replied Edward.
Yes, returned Charles, I might conceal
it without telling a positive lie; but I
could not meet their eyes in the evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>nor say my prayers if I had deceived
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Well then, answered Edward, if you
will not go on the water, I will return
home; for I do not find any amusement
here.</p>

<p class='c006'>We all thought he meant to do so;
but would you believe it, he went into
the boat without our perceiving it.—In
about half an hour we heard some one
crying out for help. We ran to the
place, with the farmer and his son.—But
what a terrible sight! We quickly
saw it was Edward who had fallen into
the river; and there was in the water
with him a boy, who was vainly endeavouring
to draw him to the bank. The
farmer hastened to their assistance, and
dragged them both out of the water;
but Edward was insensible. Emilia wept
aloud, and I was so surprised and terrified
I could not speak: Charles only
had presence of mind. He ordered that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>they should carry his cousin to the mansion-house;
and entreated his sister to
try to compose herself; your tears, said
he, will frighten our parents: we must
hasten to inform them in the gentlest
manner of this misfortune. We soon
reached the house. Lady Grandison
turned pale, and could scarcely follow
Sir Charles, who ran to meet the motionless
body which the farmer and his
son supported.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last, dear mother, Edward came
to himself; but he is still in bed, for
he caught a very violent cold. Perhaps
this accident may do him good, I wish
it may! Farewel, dear mother, I shall
write soon again.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Lady Grandison is better, and
Edward almost recovered: and he is
grown much wiser. I mentioned in my
last letter, a young boy who had jumped
into the water to save Edward: now
this was the same boy whom we assisted,
when Edward laughed at us. I thought
of the fable of the Lion and the Mouse
for certainly he would have been drowned
if this courageous boy had not been
there. But I must tell you part of a
conversation which we had concerning
this matter, when we sat in the sick
chamber.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are very kind, Charles and William,

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It would be mean to seek pleasure
only for ourselves. If I was sick, you
would, I am sure, come to visit me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is sufficient for us, to see you so
well, it might have had a worse issue.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is very true. If I had continued
a moment longer in the water, I had
been gone; and without that boy who
sells vinegar, I should not have been
able to have made you hear.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>See then, in this instance, the brotherly
love which, I said, we ought to
cultivate: we should do good to every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>fellow-creature; love all as men, but
choose our friends.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have lamented, indeed I have, that
I did not help the poor boy who ventured
his life to save mine.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are very right to acknowledge your
fault; and after such an acknowledgement,
only the ill-natured will remember
it to your disadvantage. And for
the service you may have an opportunity
of recompensing the boy, and do
not forget to do it, you are indebted to
him for life. He has been the instrument,
in the hands of providence, of
your preservation; and, perhaps, God
allowed him to save you, to impress on
your mind a useful lesson, to root out
your foolish pride. What would a
young gentleman have done on such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>occasion? He would, most probably,
have called out for help; but this hardy
boy, more accustomed to difficulties,
and having less fear, plunged in without
thinking of the danger he ran into.
Let us, then, love all our fellow-creatures;
those in the lowest condition
may be as useful, nay, more so, than
those who fill the highest station. One
common nature equally ties us to both;
are we not all children of the same
father?</p>

<p class='c006'>I had tears in my eyes, dear mother,
when I heard Charles deliver these sentiments;
his own shone; he is a good
creature. I recollected I have often seen
labouring men very compassionate. God
takes care of the meanest insect, Dr.
Bartlett says.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farewell. I forgot to tell you that
we are to go to-morrow to dine with a
sister of Sir Charles’s, whose house is
some miles distant from hence; and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>we are to rise earlier than usual, I am
going to bed, that I may not keep them
a moment in the morning waiting for
me. Edward cannot go with us, he is
very sorry, and I pity him, he will be
so dull alone; but I will lend him a
book full of stories. Once more farewell.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>We have been very happy at Lord
L——’s; I wish you had seen
how well my friend Charles behaves
himself in company. Not like young
Dulis, I assure you. He has so much
affectation and formality: he does nothing
but bow, and make compliments,
with a half-ashamed face, as if he had
done wrong, and was afraid to look the
person he spoke to in the face. Charles,
on the contrary, is polite with a noble
freedom; he walks with ease and grace;
he listens with attention, and speaks
little; but when the discourse is directed
to him, he returns a modest answer.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>I will give you an instance of his attention.
We were in the garden with
the whole party: one of the young ladies
had left her hat in the house and
complained of the heat of the sun;
Charles heard her, and ran immediately
for it. Then, with his usual mirth,
he asked permission to put it on the lady’s
head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oh, could I be like him how happy
I should be! I will try to be as attentive
and complaisant. Most people only
come into company to eat and drink.
I know, for you have told me, that
children should not converse much; but
they must not appear tired and stupidly
dumb. Is it not true, dear mother?</p>

<p class='c006'>Lady L—— has two daughters, they
are both very pleasing; the eldest, Charlotte,
sings admirably: Emilia is very
fond of her, and they have promised to
write to each other.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>—But I must not forget to tell you
what happened to us in our way home.
Sir Charles and Lady Grandison, Emilia
and another Lady rode in one carriage
on before; we were with Dr. Bartlett
in the chaise. We had not travelled
above three miles, when we saw a poor
blind old man sitting very sorrowful
under a tree. Charles stopped the carriage.
Pray, dear sir, said he, look at
that man, he appears blind and wretched;
he has nobody with him, pray let
me speak to him. He quickly received
permission, and jumped out of the carriage.
Who are you, my honest friend?
said he; who has left you alone in such
a solitary place? Alas! answered the
blind man, I am very poor, I came out
this morning to beg in the neighbouring
village, and my leader, a cruel boy,
has left me to myself, because I had
not collected enough to pay him as usual.
Ah! replied Charles, the sun is already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>set, it will soon be dark; and what will
you then do? I must perish, if God,
who is my only refuge, does not send
some one to help me. No, answered
Charles, you shall not perish; God has
sent me to help you.—Dear Dr. Bartlett,
let me be so happy as to save an
unfortunate blind man left alone, and
who might have been lost, if we had
not met with him! The night comes
on apace, where would this distressed
fellow-creature go without a guide?
We cannot be far from his house, do
take him into the chaise, I will ride behind,
that you may not be incommoded.
Dr. Bartlett would not allow him to do
so, but made room for the poor man.
Any other but Charles would, probably,
instead of offering to ride behind,
have been ashamed of being seen with a
man in such ragged clothes; but he, on
the contrary, seemed to find pleasure in
his company. In short, we only went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>a mile out of our way; and when we
left him at his cottage door, I saw
Charles slip some money into his hand,
while he modestly received the old man’s
blessing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Bartlett highly commended this
act of humanity when we reached home.
But, said Emilia, the man in rags must
have appeared an odd figure in such a
fine carriage. I never thought of that,
sister, answered Charles, I was so glad
to seize an opportunity of doing good—and
felt myself so warmly interested
about the old man’s preservation. Nobly
done, my son, said Sir Charles.
Observe, Emilia, your brother has made
a triumphal car of his carriage, which,
has done him more honour than those
the victorious Romans, whose history
you are all reading, made for their heroes;
he has saved the life of his brother—a
poor wanderer in the dark; yet,
forlorn as he appeared, that God who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>allows us to enjoy the cheerful light of
day, cares for him, and Jesus Christ
would have felt compassion for him; in
his eyes the good only were great. Come
to my arms, my son, you rejoice your
father’s heart. We were all silent for a
few moments, and tears stood in our
eyes—and I prayed that I might glad
my mother’s heart. Farewel, my dearest
mother, love your</p>

It is not very valuable I know; but I

<p class='c006'>I wish now to ask your advice; next

not transcribe for me some verses out of
that pretty book you have, which I
would present to my mother to express
my respect and good wishes, and to shew
her—No,—I believe it would not be
right—No, do not do it; I will try to
express my wishes in my own words.—Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>should mama have stolen verses?
I love her dearly, and I think I can
easily say what gratitude and love inspires;
and should my foolish tongue
falter, surely she will be able to read in
every turn of my face, the sincere affection
which warms my heart. I will
then think of what this good mother has
done for me, what misfortunes she
preserved me from; next to God, my
thanks are due to her. Indeed I do love
her, and I will endeavour to shew my
gratitude by my attention to her most
trivial commands or wishes; and I hope,
I shall never through thoughtlessness
occasion her a moment’s uneasiness: I
I should hate myself if I did.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the future, dear cousin, I will
earnestly pray to God to spare my father
and mother, the dearest earthly blessings
I enjoy. The thought of losing them
depresses my spirits:—O may God long
preserve them! Yes, yes, with these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>sentiments, I shall know very well how

</div>

<p class='c005'>I thank you, dear mother, for your
kind letter; it is so long since you
wrote to me, I was almost afraid you
were displeased with me. Hear what I
do, I always carry your last letter in my
bosom, then I can read it often, and
remember the lessons you give me. I
love dearly my little sister Annette, she
is so good, and so dutiful to you. Miss
Emilia sends her a fine doll, I am sure
it will please her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yesterday was the birth-day of Lady
Grandison. Charles was up an hour
earlier than usual, and when I awoke I
found him, for we sleep together, busy,
praying to God for his dear mother;
we read some chapters in the New Testament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and then Charles dressed
himself in his new clothes. You perhaps
may wonder at this; but I will
tell you how it was. About a month
ago Charles and Edward had each a new
summer suit, and were allowed to choose
the colour themselves. Edward wore
his as soon as it came home; but Charles
said that he would keep his till some
holiday, and this was the holiday he
fixed on. He was soon dressed, and we
joined Emilia, who stood ready at our
chamber door waiting for us.</p>

<p class='c006'>We hastened to the breakfast parlour.
Charles was the first to congratulate his
mother on this occasion; Emilia followed
him, and gave her a purse, she had
privately net: Charles, I forgot to mention,
had plucked a nosegay of his finest
flowers. I in like manner discharged
my duty as well as I could, at least with
a sincere heart, for I love my benefactors.
Edward came into the room soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>after; but he approached Lady Grandison
in a careless manner, and seemed to
be thinking of something else.</p>

<p class='c006'>We all received some presents—mine
was a microscope, the thing of all others
I wished for; how kind it was of Lady
Grandison to think of my wishes. You
will be pleased with it, and I will instruct
Annette, she shall see the wonders
I have admired.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I have here new pleasures every day,
dear mother; your William is now become
a gardener. Will you help me,
said Charles, the day before yesterday?
and if you like it, I will lay out my garden
in another manner. It is now full of
flowers; but it affords me not sufficient
employment: I would wish to change a
part of it at least into a kitchen-garden.
My answer was ready. We accordingly
went each with a small spade to work,
and quickly dug up the whole garden.
The next day we made a small bed for
the flowers, and ranged them in due order.
We rose very early to work, before the
sun was intolerably warm; the gardener
gave us some seeds which are proper to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>sow this month. Now we only desire
to see them come up, and intend carefully
to weed them. How pleasant it
will be, to see the plants shoot out of
the ground!</p>

<p class='c006'>I have seen many wonderful things
every day of my life without observing
them; but Dr. Bartlett and Charles have
taught me to see God in a tree, a flower,
a worm; we converse about them. I
will relate a conversation we had yesterday.
Charles has an aviary, he is very
fond of his birds; we had done our
work in the garden, and took a walk
with Emilia.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Excuse me, I must leave you a moment;
I recollect that I have not taken
care of my birds. We both desired to
accompany him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Pretty creatures, they seem as if they
belonged to you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That they do certainly, because they
are accustomed to eat out of my hand.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They appear to know you, but how
do they distinguish betwixt you and me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is certain that they have the
power to discern, for I have often seen,
when I come with my hat on they fly
away; and I conclude from that circumstance,
this faculty of discernment,
which I am sure they possess, is very
weak, or they would always know me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are very good to your birds, brother;
but Edward let his linnet die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>with hunger. If I was to do so, I
should never forgive myself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It would be cruel, indeed, to confine
the poor creatures, where they cannot
get any thing to eat; and then to neglect
them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But may I ask you something, Charles?
Would it not be more noble if you was
to give them their liberty? They sit
there like prisoners; we only confine
bad people, and these poor birds have
not done wrong.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No, they are not unhappy in their
confinement; God has created them for
our pleasure, though we displease him
when we treat them with cruelty.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They must yet, I think, be uneasy,
when they see others flying in the open
air, and themselves shut up.—We should
not be satisfied.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They cannot reason as we can. If we
were shut up, we should say to ourselves,
how disagreeable it is to be confined;
and how precious is liberty.
But birds have not any idea of this difference.
If we give them plenty to eat
and drink they are content, without
wishing for what they have not. That
linnet of Edward’s, you just now mentioned,
as long as he had something, he
eat it up, without any anxiety for the
future. A sign, that he had not the
power of reflecting. A man, on the
contrary, would be afraid of want, if
his provisions began to fail; and then he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>would eat sparingly; but a bird has not
any conception of wanting food—much
less his liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will only add, that I am your affectionate
son,</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Sir Charles and his Lady went yesterday
to pay a visit, and took Emilia and
Edward with them. Charles and I remained
at home with Dr. Bartlett.
After our lessons were finished, we requested
him to walk with us; the evening
was very fine, the sun was setting.
Dr. Bartlett proposed ascending a neighbouring
hill, that we might see the sun
set—for, said he, it is a fine sight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You have often told me, Sir, that the
sun did not move, but the earth on
which we live goes round the sun. If
so, why do you say, the sun sets?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is a manner of speaking which
has been taken from the earliest times,
and the term is generally used, though
the same sense is not annexed to it.
They thought formerly that the sun
moved round the earth, which it seems
to do; but we now know better, after
further enquiries, and various observations.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Should we then say that the sun
moves?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If you were in a boat, you would say
with as much propriety, that the land
and the trees moved, by which you failed;
and yet they do not move.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is true, I have often observed
it; but how comes it, that we do not
feel the motion of the earth?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Because you are accustomed to it from
your birth, and the motion of so vast a
body cannot be felt by so small a creature
as man is, in proportion. The
sun is much larger than the earth; thus
it is most reasonable to conceive, arguing
from what we know of the wisdom
of the great Mover, that the earth goes
round the sun, than that the sun moves
round the earth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And is the sun, Sir, so very large?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is well known to astronomers, that
the sun is above a million of times bigger
than the earth: judge then how
large it must be.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But how do you know all this?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By careful investigation; and as you
are fond of reading, you may yourself
be convinced of it; Charles will lend
you the Spectacle de la Nature<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. In that
excellent book you will find instruction
delivered in an easy manner.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. On this subject a more useful book has been
lately published, entitled, An Introduction to Astronomy.</p>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But I must yet ask you, Sir, how can
the sun, which you say is about ninety-five
millions of miles from us, give us
so much warmth and light?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is truly a great miracle of almighty
Power.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I am glad I know that the sun is so
large. Many think it is not larger than
it appears to us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The further any thing is from us,
the smaller it appears; as that kite for
instance, it will appear much less in the
air, than it does on the ground.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Certainly; and this is also a proof,
that the sun must be amazingly great,
because that it is at such an immense
distance from us. The moon, by the
same rule, must be very large.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The moon is large; but much less
than the earth. There are stars which
are of a much superior magnitude.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We should not think so.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That arises from the stars being still
further from us than the moon.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And is the moon also a globe of fire?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No. The moon is a dark body, it
receives its light from the sun.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>All the stars which we see, have their
names I suppose?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Not all; we have given names to
some of them, that we may better distinguish
them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I feel a great desire to be an astronomer;
it must be a very pleasing study.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That desire should be encouraged;
you will by this science learn rightly
to know the great power of your Creator.
View the setting sun—what a glorious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>scene! We should without it be
very miserable. All would lie in dreadful
darkness. It affords us light, and
it brings an agreeable warmth to the
earth; it makes the fruit and grass
grow: the earth could not bring forth
without the sun’s influence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There, the sun is set.—How comes
it that it is not now immediately dark?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That arises from the flexibility of its
beams, which we will enquire into another
time; your laudable curiosity pleases
me. Let us now reflect what great benefit
we receive from God’s allowing
the darkness to come on so gradually.
Would it not be dreadful if we came in
a moment from clear light into thick
darkness?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Very true, Sir; it would damp our
spirits, and the night would then always
surprise us before we were aware
of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is indeed happy for us that the
night comes and goes away imperceptibly.
If we passed out of darkness into
light in a moment, our eyes would be
blinded by the sudden glare; and the
surprise would discompose our minds.
The wisdom of the Almighty Creator
appears thus in every thing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I never yet thought of that benefit,
when I have seen the sun set. I am
glad, Sir, that you have pointed it out
to me, for it will make me more thankful
for the divine goodness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will send for my telescope, and then
you will have a nearer view of the moon.
And to-morrow morning I will call you
very early, and we will see the sun rise—you
will find it equally beautiful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dear mother, how happy I am to learn
all this. I already feel more love and
reverence for God, the cause of all these
wonders, than I had before. If I grew
ever so tall, I should not think myself
a man, till I knew something of the
works of God.—Can a man be wise who
sees him not in every surrounding object?
Charles and I intend to make all
the enquiries we possibly can—we will
try to be good and wise.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>We were this morning, mama, at
half past two, in the fields, to see the
beautiful scene of the sun rising. Edward
would not go with us, he rather
chose to sleep. He is very lazy, and
ignorant of course, Dr. Bartlett says.
Yet, though he plays much more than
we do, he is not so happy; he often
seems not to know what to do with
himself, idleness making the hours so
heavy. He wishes for his meals long
before the time, and torments insects
and animals wantonly to shorten the tedious
interval. I heard Sir Charles say,
the other day, he feared he would never
be a man in understanding. That instead
of rising gradually to a man, he was
sinking into a brute. But I must relate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>our conversation. The stars were yet
visible when we went out.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My father has promised me some excellent
books, Sir.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The books of wise writers, are useful
to make us more easily understand what
we see and experience; but our own
eyes may teach us a great deal. The
Book of Nature, the heavens, with all
the stars and planets; this earth on
which we are, with all its productions
and creatures, is the best book; but
others will serve as guides.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>See, Sir, I think it is lighter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Observe now, how the stars begin to
grow dim, before the approaching light
of the sun.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I thought always that the stars went
away, when it was day light.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are some which have their appointed
revolutions; and others which
are stationary; these we call the fixed
stars.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Are there stars then by day as well as
by night?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Certainly. But the stronger light of
the sun, makes the fainter light of the
stars invisible.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How beautiful the trees and fields
begin to appear.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes. What just now appeared a scene
of confusion, is changed into a charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>country. The fields, which were before
not to be distinguished, now seem green,
and decked with a thousand flowers.
The light gives all again their colours.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What you say is remarkable. I begin
to imagine that the light gives the colours.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Without light, would not all be black?
But this is a subject you cannot understand,
till you have read and considered
things more maturely. See there, the
sun begins to appear. What think you
of that sight?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>

<p class='c006'>Such men make themselves unworthy

should be excited.</p>

<p class='c006'>You are mistaken; the field flowers
are innumerable. Look round about

to say so.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>These fruits are the gift of our Creator,
for which you ought to be thankful;
but believe me, these blades on
which we tread are of yet greater value.
They support the cattle who yield us
such delicate food, milk, butter, and
cheese. The useful horse here renews
his strength; and the sheep, whose
wool answers so many purposes, which
keeps us warm both day and night, nip
the short grass every where spread. And
all this happens without our labour, or
any great care; while the fruits and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>flowers in the garden, require perpetual
attention. Certainly we find here a much
greater proof of God’s goodness than in
our flower garden. This grass is necessary,
my friends, but the flowers and
the fruits we could live without.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Because we accustom ourselves to consider
things in a wrong point of view;
and to imagine those of little value
which we obtain without art or labour.
Come, my young friends, let us correct
this mistake; let us not undervalue
even the grass; let us always acknowledge
it to be the liberal gift of heaven,
intended to support both man and
beast.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are beautiful creatures; how

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>God has given the fish another kind
of body; because they were designed
for the water, to inhabit the great deep.
They have fins to move themselves from
place to place; and besides that, the tail
is of great use to them in swimming;
and the fins, which they have on their
backs and bellies, enable them to keep
themselves upright.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You must have observed, that they
first draw the water in, and then immediately
spurt it out again: they obtain
by this continual motion, the air which
is necessary.</p>

  </div>

<p class='c006'>Yes. And to convince yourself of
this, you have only to use your microscope,
and you will plainly see an innumerable
quantity of creatures sporting
in the comparatively small space.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You fill me with astonishment. Pray
let us go home directly, I long to view
this new world of creatures.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Bartlett commended his curiosity.
We returned home; and after we had
swallowed a hasty breakfast, carried a
glass of the river water into our play-room.
We soon saw that what Dr.
Bartlett said was true. Certainly, my
dear mother, that glass of water was a
sea full of all sorts of creatures, of wonderful
forms. I never thought that there
were such small living creatures. How
admirable is the wisdom of God! for you
recollect that so small a body must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>members and bowels, as perfect for the
purposes of life as the largest animal.
We have discovered all this through the
assistance of the microscope; but my letter

all that we have discovered. Bless your

</div>

<p class='c005'>Sir Charles and Lady Grandison have
been for some days from home; but Dr.
Bartlett is with us. The house-keeper,
and all the servants, consult Emilia, and
she, in the most modest manner, tells
them what she knows her mother wishes
them to do. She is not allowed to command
any of them; the house-keeper in
particular, a respectable woman, Lady
Grandison said, ought not to receive orders
from a child; but she behaves with
such propriety, they are all eager to
oblige her; indeed she follows her brother’s
example. Edward, on the contrary,
does nothing but romp and wrestle,
and afterwards quarrel with them. He
hates all employment; I should imagine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>those who do not learn when they
are young, must appear very foolish
when they are old. You shall hear what
Charles said to him yesterday. Charles,
Emilia, and I sat on one side of the
room, drawing; while Edward tied a
thread to a beetle—and often he would
jump, as if by accident, against our
chairs, to disturb us and make us leave
our employment. Charles spoke to him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Ah, Edward, what pleasure can you
find in torturing a poor insect? It
turns me sick to see you; pray let it
go!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And what do you do, when you and
William set the butterflies on a needle
to look at them through your fine microscope?
That pleases you, and this
pleases me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If William and I set the butterflies
on a needle, only for our amusement,
it would be wrong; but we do it to instruct
ourselves—yet, though we seek
instruction, I could not bear to torture
them; the sight of their agonies would
engross my whole attention. Dr. Bartlett
has taught me to kill them expeditiously
without injuring their appearance.
I then gratify my curiosity without hardening
my heart, for that tender-hearted
man, our dear tutor, often says, that
even the attainment of knowledge cannot
compensate for a quick emotion of
benevolence, banished by a habit of
thoughtless cruelty. He wishes to make
me wise; but still more ardently to incite
me to practise goodness, to shew
kindness to the insects who crawl under
my feet; and to let my love mount up
from them to the beings, who, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>they enjoy the blessings of heaven, can
recognize the hand which bestows them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Well, if you will come with me into
the garden, I will let it go.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is to say, that if I refuse to go
with you, you will continue to torment
the poor insect. It is not it’s fault if I
do not go with you—surely this is not
right; but I will accompany you.</p>

<p class='c006'>I reproved your too great fondness for

those who cannot play with temper, in
my opinion, ought never to play at all.
It is not amiss to know how to play,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>because that cards are so much used in
company, and it enables one to oblige
those who are fond of this amusement.
I do not find any pleasure in it; and I
hope never, from a false pride, to be
induced to play for more than I can afford
to lose.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poor Mr. Beverley, who died last
week, and left his family in great distress,
my mama told me, first played to
avoid being laughed at, and called a
mean-spirited man. He went on from
one thing to another, till he spent his
whole fortune, and ruined his constitution.
His wife actually took in needlework
to support him during his last illness,
though she had been educated to
expect better things. He died in an
obscure lodging, a burden to the woman
he ought to have been a comfort to;
and left his half-starved babes, to weep
over the lifeless body of their inconsiderate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>parent. I wept too—when I heard
of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The conversation was interrupted, but
I must tell you Emilia had tears in her
eyes, when she told us about poor Mr.
Beverley’s children. I remember now
I used to be vexed when young Dulis
laughed at me, and called me a coward,
when I refused to do mischief; and
mean, when I saved my money, though
I intended to give it to a poor blind
man; but he did not know that. I do
not like to tell any one but yourself that
I give most part of my allowance to the
poor; it would look as if I wanted to
be praised, and that the love of praise
was my motive; but indeed it is not,
the pleasure I feel at the moment, is a
sufficient reward. Besides, I think I
resemble my dear mother, and I am
happy.—I am sure you will love me, if
I practise virtue.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>One of the servants has been very ill.
You cannot think how compassionately
Emilia attended her. She rose very early
this morning to carry her some refreshment,
and tried to amuse her. She requested
Dr. Bartlett to send for a physician;
and she took as much care of
her as if the poor girl had been her own
sister. Edward reproached her. It well
becomes you, said he, to be sure, to
wait on the maid. And why not, answered
she; you play with the servant
to amuse yourself (and such a degree of
familiarity is indeed improper) and I
take care of the maid, through pity. A
servant is a human being; we are differently
educated, I cannot make them
my companions, but I will ever try to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>treat them humanely—and remember
that they are my fellow-creatures,
when they are in distress. Edward was
ashamed and ran out of the room. My
mother, I thought, always acted in the
same manner. I remember well, when
our Hannah had the fever, that you took
care of her yourself. But it brings to
my remembrance something, which
makes me sorrowful. How unfortunate
you are! Here are so many servants,
and you, my poor mother, have
only a little girl to assist; you yourself
are obliged to do many things—a
colonel’s widow should have servants to
wait on her; it is mean to work, and
do not people despise you for being reduced
to such a condition? When I am
a man, and have increased my fortune,
you shall have servants, and live as a
gentlewoman ought to live.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I admire Emilia, she is a good, and
a pleasing girl; there is not a more
amiable virtue than compassion. It is
much to be wished that all young ladies
would take her for their pattern; and,
instead of falling into the two shameful
extremes, familiarity and haughtiness,
which are often to be observed in the
same character, they would treat their
servants with humanity and decent kindness.
You know how frequently I have
praised you for your affability to your
inferiors.—But, William, why are you
grieved that I have but one servant? A
number of servants are not necessary;
they serve more for shew than use. Had
I riches, I would try not to waste the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>precious deposit; I would live according
to my station. And while my own
real and artificial wants were supplied,
I should think with pleasure, that though
so many servants were not necessary to
wait on me, I enabled some industrious
fellow-creatures to earn an honest livelihood;
and by humane treatment made
their labour pleasant. But since it has
not pleased heaven to give me riches, I
am content, and thankful that I can
keep a girl to do the most laborious and
menial part of my household business,
which I could not do without injuring
my health, and neglecting your sister’s
education. I am not in absolute need
of any more assistance. And what now
is that employment, which, you say, is
unbecoming the widow of a colonel?
You wrote hastily, it is not dishonourable
to serve ourselves when we cannot
afford to pay for the services of others.
It will be more satisfaction to you, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>be able to say, after my death, my mother
provided her own dinner; her
clothes were the work of her hands;
her economy made up for the deficiencies
of fortune; and her virtues made
her respectable; than if you heard
your parent reproached, for living according
to her rank, and birth. She
had a fine house, rich furniture, a number
of servants; but she has left nothing
behind her; and what is still worse,
has injured several industrious people
who trusted to her honour. What
would then be the son of a colonel?
A despised youth, who, though innocent,
must blush for his mother’s want
of thought and justice. The son of a
reputable tradesman, would scarcely acknowledge
him as an equal; but I have
laid enough, I hope, to dissipate your
false pride and concern for me: you
find I am satisfied with my station.
Again let me tell you, your letters are a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>comfort to me; was I much poorer than
I am, I should still esteem myself rich
in the possession of such a son.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>We have been greatly alarmed, dear
mother. Mr. Wilson’s house was last
night burned to the ground. Oh what
frightful flames! The air was as red
as blood; my heart beat very strong, I
trembled lest the family should be destroyed
in their beds.—It was dreadful
to see such devastation by fire; how careful
we ought to be to avoid the sudden
horror of so terrible a calamity. If
they had been careful, this misfortune
would not have happened; the two
Miss Wilsons were the occasion of it.
They had in the evening, without its
being observed, lighted a fire in their
play-room; and spread the coals on the
hearth to bake privately some cakes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The fire must certainly have caught the
boards; but they did not perceive it;
as they were interrupted before the cakes
were half baked, and obliged to go to
their mother, who called for them.
They swallowed hastily the unwholesome,
and even unpalatable cakes, and
shut the door without thinking any more
about it. The flames did not burst out
till the whole family had been some
time fast asleep. There is not any thing
saved. All the furniture, clothes, and
the stock of the farm were reduced to
ashes. The poor girls escaped with only
a single petticoat on; and Mrs. Wilson
was with difficulty rescued from the devouring
flames, which consumed all her
substance.</p>

<p class='c006'>What will now become of that pride,
which made the Miss Wilsons treat with
such disdain the neighbouring farmers
daughters, because they were their inferiors
in birth and fortune—and now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>they are happy to find a shelter in the
houses they despised. Indeed, mama,
I will obey you, and ever behave with
kindness to my inferiors. But I have
something else to tell you, and I am
sure you will not be angry with me; I
sent some of my clothes to the Miss
Wilson, who is about my size; I have
more than I want—and surely, mama,
if that was not the case, I ought cheerfully
to bear a trifling inconvenience to
do a fellow-creature an essential service.
Wearing for the first time new clothes,
never gave me half the pleasure—no, it
cannot be compared with what I felt,
when I gave away my old ones. I did
not send my best (though I would have
parted with them without feeling any
reluctance) as I thought, common
clothes would suit her better. Farewel,
dear mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am just returned, my dear father,
from visiting poor Mr. Wilson. Emilia
has written my mother an account of
the dreadful accident which happened
last night; and I wish, ardently wish,
to alleviate the distress I could scarcely
behold without tears—indeed I believe
I should have wept, if I had not been
full of a plan, which darted into my
head, when I heard the grey-headed old
man lament the disaster, which, in the
course of one night, swept away the
hard-earned fruits of many toiling years.
To be plunged into poverty, said he,
when my strength faileth me, and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the sweat of my brow will not procure
the necessaries of life—is sad. And so
it is; now I will tell you what I have
thought of. You know my uncle left
me five thousand pounds—I think it a
great fortune, and I can surely spare two
hundred to help Mr. Wilson out of his
extreme distress; that sum would be
sufficient to stock another farm. I shall
be rich enough, and the more so, as
you are so good as to let the interest accumulate.
I beg, Sir, you will not refuse
my humble request—I shall have
more satisfaction in relieving this unfortunate
man, than ever my two hundred
pounds can give. To rescue from poverty
an industrious man and his family,
what a blessing! In this respect, let me
be like my father, who is himself so benevolent,—who
has taught me to be
compassionate. Were you but here, I
would throw myself at your feet, and—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>it is enough, you will judge if my
request merits your attention; my duty
is submission, and I know I need not
try to persuade you—you will at once
do what appears to you right.</p>

<p class='c005'>You have learned of me, you say, to
be compassionate. It has ever been my
wish and endeavour, to make your heart
feel the miseries of your fellow-creatures;
and I have laboured to inculcate
the virtue, which next to the love, the
goodness of God ought to inspire, is
the noblest ornament of our nature.
The request you make is a proof of the
warm generosity of your heart: and so
praise worthy a desire merits a reward.
The fresh discovery I have made of your
benevolent disposition, is of more value,
in my estimation, than the two hundred
pounds, which you will find enclosed.
Go, my Charles, make glad poor Wilson’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>heart, and taste the delight, which
flows from benevolence. But let me
tell you, the legacy must not be touched
before you are of age: it was entrusted
to my care as a guardian, and not as
a father.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>You were right, my dear Emilia,
when you imagined I could not be angry
with you for following the humane
dictates of your heart. As a proof of
my approbation of your conduct, and
to reward you for it, I will give you
another opportunity of experiencing the
pleasure which arises from benevolence.
You will find in my drawers a piece of
calico; send for the mantua-maker, and
desire her to make Mrs. and Miss Wilson
a dress immediately. I know this
commission will afford you more pleasure,
than if I gave it you for yourself.
But, my Emilia, why did you mention
their faults, when you related the circumstances
which made them truly objects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to excite my commiseration. You
might silently have determined to behave
properly to your inferiors, without
exhibiting the disagreeable picture of
their haughtiness, when it was receiving
a severe chastisement. Never, my child,
add to the miseries of others, even though
the sufferers should be unworthy.—Be
tender-hearted in every sense of the
word. I do not mean to chide you,
when I point out an error; you are a
good girl.—You were judicious in not
sending your best clothes; you considered
the wants of the person you wished
to assist, and your generosity had not
that tincture of vanity which very frequently
degrades it. Always, my child,
define rather to do good, than to display
your goodness: remember that the best
of Beings notes your secret thoughts;
and that it is truly noble to have sometimes
his approbation singly in view.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Farewel, forget not the useful lesson
you have given yourself, never to be
proud of clothes or furniture; an unforeseen
casualty might deprive you of
them, and even the riches which procured
them. “Lay up then a treasure
in heaven; where neither rust, nor
moth can corrupt; nor thieves break
through and steal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>What a pleasure you have allowed
me to enjoy, my dear father! indeed I
know not how to thank you for it; but
I will tell you how happy you have
made Mr. Wilson, and that will reward
you. The tears rolled down his
cheeks as he pressed the hand I held
out;—but I must relate the particulars.
Mr. Wilson has a great spirit; I was
afraid it would hurt him to receive a
present from a boy; I wished to have
put it in his snuff-box, to have avoided
hurting his delicacy; but I could not
contrive to do it unobserved. I then
offered to lend him the sum he wanted,
and refused a note he would have given
me, and ran out of the house—I did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>want thanks—I rather wished to thank
God for permitting me to relieve a fellow-creature.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>We went yesterday with Dr. Bartlett
to visit a farm-house, where there are
some bee-hives. I had often heard of
bees, but I never saw them work before.
What wonderful little creatures! but I
will give you our conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Will not these bees hurt us, Sir?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No. But we must not make any
violent noise; we must approach them
softly. Look, you may imagine you
view a whole city, well peopled; where
every one does his best to earn a subsistence
in an honest way; none here stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>idle. What a lesson for the sluggard
who wastes his time in idleness, and is
a burden to himself and others.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Have they made those little holes entirely
themselves?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes. They are always employed;
they take care in the summer to provide
food for the winter; and build themselves
little rooms in which they are
preserved from the cold. They pay
also a necessary attention to cleanliness;
they carefully throw out any accidental
dirt, and the dead bees.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But, Sir, if it should happen that a
snail, or any other insect enters the
hive, would they immediately drive it
away?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When they find such an insect, after
they have killed it, they enclose it in
wax, so that no damage can arise from
it.—Observe what harmony reigns in
the hive; every one has his particular
post. One flies out to gather honey;
another takes care of the wax; and a
third has his business in the hive. They
who remain at home, come to the entrance
of the hive, to take the load
from those who fly abroad: and this
way they relieve and help each other.
We may then justly compare them to a
virtuous family; where every one is
diligently employed to make his companions
happy.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c006'>But I think I see one much larger

    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Bees are of great use to us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Certainly. We should without them,
have neither honey nor wax; which are
both very useful for various purposes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But, Sir, is it not hard that we should
rob the bees of their honey, which they
have so industriously gathered for themselves?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It would be cruel, indeed, if we did
not leave them a sufficient quantity.
Providence, in the whole of creation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>considered the wants of man; yet did
not neglect to supply those of the meanest
of his creatures. We are allowed
to govern them, and partake of the
dainties they procure; but the master
must not degenerate into a tyrant—a
cruel spoiler.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c006'>I never could endure bees, because
they sting; but for the future I will
love them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do so, and remember that there are
many other things which you despise,
only because you cannot discern their
use, or have not thought about it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>

<p class='c006'>What kind of an understanding have
the bees?</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We distinguish it by the name of instinct.
It is instilled at once; and does
not grow gradually, and improve as
our faculties, if properly employed, always
will.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c006'>Are there no means to enable men to
procure honey? for they see the bees
collect it from the flowers and herbs.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No certainly. We will look at a bee
through the microscope, and then you
will discover the instrument, with which
they collect their treasure; an instrument
which all the art of man cannot
prepare.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Bartlett said very true; we took
a bee home, and looked at it through
our glass—I wish I could give you a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>description of it; but you shall see it in
my microscope, when we meet in your

<p class='c005'>Oh! my dear mother, my friend
Charles has scalded his leg, and cannot
walk. Edward, who always does things
rashly, was the occasion of it, by throwing
down a kettle of boiling water. But
I never saw such patience, such goodness
as Charles possesses. Instead of being
angry, he, on the contrary, concealed
the pain he felt. It is nothing, said
he, it has not hurt me much, do not
make yourself uneasy Edward. But we
soon perceived how it was, for his leg
swelled so suddenly, they were obliged
to cut his stocking, before they could
get it off. Emilia began to cry, and
upbraid Edward for his carelessness;
and thoughtlessly wished he had scalded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>himself. Charles interrupted her; I do
not wish any one to suffer, said he; be
composed, dear sister, my leg will not,
I hope, be much the worse. Edward
did not do it on purpose, it was an
accident; reproaches cannot mend the
matter; and if it was worse we ought
rather to encourage each other. He
then sent for the house-keeper, and requested
her to dress it—and hearing
Dr. Bartlett’s foot-step, entreated his
sister not to mention Edward as the
cause of the accident; your anger, he
added, gives me more pain than the
scald.</p>

<p class='c006'>How happy it is when we can command
such presence of mind—such composure
in a moment. Tell me, does it
not arise from thinking more of what
others suffer, than the actual pain we
ourselves endure? Had he been fretful,
it would not have done him any good;
I should have pitied, without admiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>him, as I now do.—But the pleasure
I find in writing to my dear mother,
makes me forget that he desired me to
keep him company. I give you then a
night kiss in the thoughts of my heart.

</div>

<p class='c005'>Charles begins to walk a little. I
love him, and if I was not excited by
affection, my sense of duty would prompt
me to attend him now he is sick. Besides,
I have much pleasure when we are
alone together. We were yesterday busy
with our glasses the whole afternoon.
Dear mother, what amazing things there
are which we cannot see with our naked
eye. Should you think there are living
creatures in a small grain of sand, and
that those grains of sand contain small
holes, in which they hide themselves.
The mould that is in old cheese, appears
like a wood of trees, with branches
and leaves. In the hair of the head, we
discovered a tube, through which a juice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>ran. Who would believe that small insects,
scarcely visible, have blood vessels
and bowels, constructed with as
much care as those of the largest
animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the flowers, they are indeed
beautiful. Come, said Charles, let us
see the difference between the works of
God and man. We employed our attention
on the natural rose first; all was
splendid and perfect: we then viewed
an artificial rose; but what a difference!
All was rough and disagreeable, and the
beauty vanished. We looked at some
highly polished steel; but it appeared
like unwrought rusty iron. What then
is the art of man, compared with the
almighty power of the Creator? Nothing,
indeed!—Oh that every body
knew this! They would have more reverence
for the Supreme Being. But
what do we? We pluck a flower—we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>keep it some hours; and then throw it
away without thinking that the greatest
effort of human art could not produce
such another. We slowly labour—but
God spoke—and it was done.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Charles and Lady Grandison are
expected this afternoon. We are all
glad, the servants join in the general
joy. Is it not a good sign, when the
servants are attached to their masters? I
will endeavour to be good and humane,
when I am a man, it is so delightful
to be loved.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I must again speak of my friend
Charles. Dr. Bartlett asked us after
breakfast if we would take a short walk.
Charles, who is much better, desired
to be excused going with us. My leg,
said he, is not quite well; if I walk
much on it, my father and mother
would perceive it, and I do not wish to
give them a moment’s uneasiness, I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>rather lose the pleasure of the walk. He
then remained in his chamber, and Emilia,
Edward, and I, accompanied Dr.
Bartlett, and we had the following conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Why is it not always summer, Sir?
The summer is far more delightful than
the winter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If it was always summer, we should
not enjoy as much pleasure as we do at
present. The succession of the seasons
rouses our attention, and gives variety
to the year; you would be tired of the
most beautiful prospect, if it never varied.
You have experienced this very
often, I believe. Some months ago, I
gave you an optic glass, and you were so
pleased with it that you would leave off
eating to amuse yourself with the wonders
it discovered: now your curiosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>sleeps, it is thrown aside; some months
hence it may come in play again. So it
is with the trees and flowers; the change
of summer and winter is adapted to our
nature, while the earth is allowed a
resting time; during which it gathers
fresh strength to bud forth in the beautiful
livery of spring.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I never viewed it in this light. Oh!

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c006'>Dare you then touch one, Edward?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes. Look at me, I will touch one.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may without danger touch a frog,

from a toad.—But it is most prudent
not to play with any animal you are not

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By no means. You know, for example,
that it gives you pain when you
take hold of a nettle: have you then
reason to cry out when you see a nettle?
Those little creatures, even though provided
with a weapon to defend themselves,
or revenge an injury, will not
seek you: they are more afraid of you
than you of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They fear us yet more. You have
often seen how they run away, if they
hear the least noise. I for my part am
more afraid of fleas and gnats than of
rats and mice. What do all these creatures
in the world? They are of no use.</p>

they are. All that we discover the
cause of in God’s works, is good: and
our ignorance ought not to make us
doubt of his goodness. A spider, for
instance, you would say, is a disagreeable
useless insect.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am afraid of a spider, Sir.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is a weakness, my dear William,
which you must try to conquer; you
shall draw some spiders for me. Now
a spider, that insect so odious in your
eyes, is of great service to us by his diligence.
At the time that the grapes
and other fruits begin to ripen, he
spins a curious web to cover them from
the flies and other insects, without doing
the fruit any injury. And from this
slight circumstance we may conclude
with reason, that most things in the
earth are serviceable, though we know
not their particular use.</p>

<p class='c006'>Look, William, what a fine house,
I wish I lived in such a noble one.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And why, Emilia; think you that
that house, because it appears so stately,
is more convenient than the one you
inhabit?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is much larger, Sir.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The family may be in proportion to
its size, if not, great part of it is useless,
you have in your’s, all that you
ought to desire.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c006'>It looks well, I think, to live in such
a fine house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My dear Emilia, that shewy appearance
is chiefly for those that pass
by, as you do now; there are possibly
more wants in that house than in your’s.
Let us always try to be satisfied with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>what we have, for otherwise, if you had
that house you would not be content,
you would still see a better; and so you
would never have done wishing.</p>

<p class='c006'>We were silent a few moments, when
Dr. Bartlett called hastily to Emilia, and
desired her to cast her eyes on a decayed
cottage, near the road side.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That looks miserable; there is but a
small window in it: those who live in
it can have very little light.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But, miserable as it appears, your fellow-creatures
live in it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They have reason to complain.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Think you so? No. They are happy
to have such an house. How many are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>there who have scarcely a covering to
sleep under; and who, when it begins
to be dark, benumbed with rain and
cold, know not where to sleep.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I am distressed. Ah, if all men were
as well provided for as I am, that would
quench the thirst of wishing.—But I
see a poor boy, perhaps he is looking
for a shelter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Very possibly.</p>

<p class='c005'>He shall sleep this night under a roof,
said Emilia, as she ran to give the boy
something. I really pitied him, and gave
him a trifle. The poor fellow looked
pleased. How happy are the rich that
they can give to the poor!</p>

<p class='c005'>Yesterday, when we returned
home, we found Charles in the parlour
waiting for us, and ready to receive his
father and mother, who soon after arrived.
He forgot the pain in his leg,
and ran eagerly to meet them; indeed
he loves his parents. We were this
night to sup with Sir Charles and his
Lady, a pleasure we do not often enjoy,
as we go to bed early: they retired to
settle some business, and we were left
alone together while the cloth was laying.
Emilia was just going to play us
a tune, when we heard some china fall.</p>

is, nor how it has happened. The name
of ass suits not a man.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I know it is in pieces; servants use
things as if they cost nothing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will go and see. I think the damage
is not so great as you suppose.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What then, he will do well; would
not you be glad if you had done wrong
that he should apologize for you? He
has often taken your part.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>EDWARD.</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Here he comes. One would think
from his face, that he had done the
mischief. Well, Charles, what is it?
Did I not guess right that it was broke
to pieces?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was, indeed, one of the best china
plates; but why are you so angry? the
loss is not irreparable.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If I was Lady Grandison, I would
make them pay for it; it would teach
them to be more careful another time.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That would be hard for a servant,
who ought to gain by his service.
But, Edward, have you never had any
accident—and are you sure you will
always be careful?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes. If it was but pouring boiling
water over a person; that is much
worse.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Why do you trouble yourself about
it? And, Charles, if you were a master,
would you let your servants break and
destroy with impunity?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I do not believe there are any servants
who break things on purpose. It is always
by accident, and an accident should
be excused.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is pure good-nature certainly. A
careless servant will then with you never
do wrong. But my aunt, I think, ought
to know what is broken.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I intend to tell her; and to ask her to
forgive the person who did it through
thoughtlessness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And the person was one of the servants,
who was it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Suppose I should say you have done
the mischief yourself?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I—That is truly a fine story.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Did you not take a plate off the sideboard
to carry your dog some meat on:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and did you not leave it near the hall
door on a chair?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes. But what of that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The servant in the dark threw it
down.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And could I help that? How came
he to go in the dark?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That we all do very often. You are
to blame, the plate was set in an improper
place; the servant could not imagine
that it stood there.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are always prating, Miss.—But,
Charles, my aunt need not hear of it,
she will not miss a plate.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Edward!—ah Edward! you were in
a hurry to inform her when you imagined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the blame would fall on another;
but you are less eager now you must
bear the reproof yourself. Let this teach
you not to be severe on others, as this accident
must convince you, that you are
not faultless. It is our own faults which
make us so ready to mark the errors
our fellow-creatures run into.</p>

<p class='c005'>The supper came in, and during the
repast, Charles mentioned the accident;
and a slight caution from Lady Grandison
concluded the conversation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Charles has played Emilia and me
a fine trick this morning, dear mother.
Dr. Bartlett generally rises with the sun
to take a walk before breakfast; Charles,
who was this morning just awake, heard
him. He rose softly out of bed, hurried
on his clothes, and ran down to
ask him, in both our names, if we
might go with him; to which he consented.
It was hardly light. Charles
knocked at his sister’s chamber door,
Emilia, Emilia! are you still asleep,
you little think it is almost ten o’clock.
Oh! cried Emilia, what shall I do? I
am afraid my mama will be angry with
me. Come dress yourself quickly, said
Charles, I will speak a good word for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>you. Emilia was quickly dressed; she
was ashamed of being so lazy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the mean while he came to me,
and told me the same story. Eleven
o’clock—is it possible? But why did
you not call me when you got up?
And how comes it to be so dark? Does
it rain? That signifies nothing, he replied,
it will soon clear up. Come,
make haste, I want to go to Dr. Bartlett.
Well, you would have laughed
to have seen our astonishment, when
Emilia and I found it was but five
o’clock. And we were very glad we
had a pleasant walk, and the following
conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>See there, our John and his son, already
busy at their work.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They rise with the sun, and begin
their daily labour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Those people are certainly very laborious,
and labour for little profit. I
pity them, their situation is hard.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Why, that little profit is sufficient
to purchase content, if they are not
vicious.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But it is tiresome to be obliged to
work from morning till night. All
good men ought to be rich, I think.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It would quite alter the nature of
things. The strong and the weak must
then dig their own ground; and the ingenious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>would want a spur to assist the
stupid. We must all make our own
clothes; manufactures and arts would
be no more—industry would languish,
and life not only lose its principal
charms, but cease to be a probationary
state, a field to exercise virtue in, and
exert benevolence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is true, Sir.—But may I ask
you something? Does it not look as if
God, who has appointed men to work,
had less love for them than the rich?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Certainly not. God has an equal love
for all, William, that are virtuous. A
labourer in his low station, and in his
poor cottage, is often happier than those
who are exalted to high offices, and
reside in noble palaces.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The rich have servants to wait on
them, while the poor labourer must continually
work for his bread.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They who serve themselves, are best
served, my love, and labour is healthful.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What a slender table is provided for
the poor man—and how hard is his
bed!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is so—and notwithstanding this, the
poor eat their slender meal with a better
relish, than the great have for the rarest
delicacies of their tables. And they
sleep sounder on their flock-beds than
the rich on beds of down. Happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>consists in being satisfied—that is the
greatest riches on earth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You make me easy, Sir. I understand
it—God loves those men, and cares
for them as well as the rich.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes. God is the Father of the poorest
wretch, who earns his bread by the
sweat of his brow; and he may call the
greatest monarch brother: there is no
difference, except what arises from degrees
of goodness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What fine cows.—They are very good
to suffer themselves to be milked.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are mistaken, it is not goodness
in those creatures; it is to the wise
order of God that all the praise belongs.
The milk would be burdensome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>to them, if we let them hold it,
and for this reason they generally come,
at the usual hour, to the place where
they are milked.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is certainly very happy for men,
that there are cows, for milk is a great
dainty.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is not only a dainty, but a useful
necessary provision; without milk we
should have neither butter nor cheese.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And they are of great value. Their
wool serves to clothe us—where should
we find warm covering for our beds if
there were no sheep?</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>We ought to love him, because he
has created all these creatures for us;—but
I know not why we kill them, and
then eat them up; it seems cruel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By no means. They were designed
for us, for our food; if we were to let
all the sheep live, they would soon grow
so numerous they would die for want of
pasturage.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then men do right, when they kill
them?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is necessary; and they do not foresee,
or taste the bitterness of death, if
they are killed instantly.—Cruel, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>are those, who torment them—they
sin against their own souls—and
they will be judged without mercy who
have not shewn any. He who is guilty
of a cruel action has sapped the foundation
of content; and the monster,
no longer humane, enjoys not human
comforts. Nor is he thoughtless, like
the beasts of prey; conscience haunts
him—he cannot hide himself, nor find
darkness thick enough to conceal his
crimes.</p>

<p class='c005'>We now returned home, and found
Sir Charles and his Lady already in the
breakfast parlour. We mentioned the
trick Charles had played us, they both
laughed; but Sir Charles turned to
him, I mean not gravely to reprove
you, my son, only to point out to you,
that truth is so sacred a thing it ought
not to be jested with; lest a reverence
for it should imperceptibly wear away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and leave the mind, stripped of its most
beautiful ornament, to deck itself in
gaudy rags.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farewel, dear mother, I will try to
remember all these useful lessons; and
to strengthen my good resolutions by
your advice, write often to your</p>

<p class='c005'>I must tell you of another walk
which we had yesterday noon. The
summer will soon be over, we take our
pleasure while the weather is fine; and
Dr. Bartlett says, we never can choose
a more innocent diversion than a walk.
It was very warm, and to avoid the heat
of the sun darting directly over our
heads, our friend conducted us to a
wood, which is not far from the house.
Emilia remained at home with her mother,
who was a little indisposed;
Emilia always cheerfully attends to her
duty. But I will communicate the subjects
we talked about.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How agreeable is the shade of the
trees!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>True, Charles. The woods appear
designed for our delight; we find here
a refreshing breeze in the heat of the
day; and can think and talk, not exhausted
by the relaxing noon-tide beams.
A stream, whose very sound is cooling,
renders the scene more tranquil; and
the numerous songs, which are poured
forth from every spray, does not interrupt
it; all is peaceful. Do not overlook
the variety of plants, which present
themselves to our view.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And are all these plants of use, Sir?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We cannot always trace the wisdom
or the goodness of God; but, though
invisible, still it exists every where, and
is ever active—gives harmony to the
birds, and healing powers to the plants
which decorate the earth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>So then, we cannot go one step but
we find the goodness of God. Do the
woods and forests rise of themselves?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No. Nothing arises of itself, but
from seed. How the first seed was
sown, we know not; now it happens by
chance, accidents which escape our notice,
or birds carry them from one place
to another.——God worketh here as in
secret, and beauties are unexpectedly
spread around, and surprise the contemplative
walker.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Men, then, have all the pleasure
which the woods afford, without much
trouble.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But the advantage is even greater than
the pleasure. Where should we go if
there was no wood? We could not cross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the sea to visit distant lands—we must
remain on the spot where first we drew
breath, without a house or any useful
furniture: and, in many countries,
without fuel to soften the rigors of the
wintry season.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But as we are every year, nay every
day, destroying the wood, what will be
left for our posterity?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You need not be afraid of that, my
dear Charles, the world has now continued
for near six thousand years.—What
wood we annually consume, is
again annually supplied by shoots; and
thus the face of nature is renewed—God
takes care!</p>

<p class='c005'>Charles thanked Dr. Bartlett for his
instructions, and we returned—and how
happy am I, dear mother, that I can
partake in these instructions.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Charles has just been with me to shew
me a canary-bird which he has bought,
he intends to tame it.—But I must not
forget to tell you, to-morrow is Charles’s
birth-day. Edward thinks we shall have
some dainties; but Emilia says, she is
sure her brother will not spend his father’s
present in such a way;—and I
agree with her, and imagine he will
lay out his money in books, rather than
dainties, which he seldom seeks for.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LETTER XXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to his</i> <span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>You will wonder, my dear mother,
at Charles; he did not buy books with
the money—but you shall hear all about
it. His father came into his room before
he had finished his prayers, I was
in the next room; I had said mine, and
waited for him to go with him to Dr.
Bartlett. He rose hastily when his father
entered, who laid a paper on the
table, and desired him to conclude the
sacred duty he was employed in, before
he paid any respect to his earthly father;—and
saying so, he left the
chamber.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Charles joined me he opened
the paper, and found four guineas—he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>paused a moment.—William, said he, I
wish to have your opinion, we have in
our neighbourhood but few young people,
we must have a dance, we all love
dancing, and we may be merry, without
spending money in sweetmeats and unnecessary
dainties. Well then, said Charles,
I will gratify my own inclination: and
immediately we joined the breakfast table.
When we were alone with Sir
Charles, my friend addressed him, May
I, Sir, do what I please with the money
you have given me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, certainly, I gave it you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then I know who shall celebrate my
birth-day, if you approve of it—and I
shall be quite happy if you consent.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Well, who?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have more money than I want, I
will invite a few acquaintance not to
disappoint my sister and Edward, and
indeed I do not wish to make a show of
self-denial, or to let all my acquaintance
know that I give my money to the poor.
One guinea will be sufficient for the
treat, and the other three I will give to
two poor families, to buy cloathing for
their children. How happy will these
poor people be! all those I shall invite
have abundance, I do not desire they
should admire my treat and call me generous,
when I should only be vain.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Can you suppose, my dear Charles,
that I should disapprove of your intention?
You begin the year very well,
and may expect the happiness which
flows from benevolence: it is an omen
and a foretaste.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Charles then modestly thanked his
father, and I went with him to distribute
the money; afterwards we danced
with a light heart, indeed we had a
pleasant evening.——While we were
dancing, as Sir Charles passed by his
son, he whispered him, Pleasure is sweet
when we do not sacrifice our duty to
purchase it. And as he repeated his
blessing, when Charles wished him a
good night, he added, You have been
happy, my son, because you first thought
of making others rejoice.—I shall not
forget this lesson, for I felt its force.
I am sleepy, and yet I must tell you,
that while the company were refreshing
themselves, Charles and I slipped away,
and hastened to the barn, and found the
invited poor regaling merrily; I cannot
describe the pleasure that was pictured
on every countenance, but it has left a
pleasing impression on my mind. The
people were so delighted with their good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>cheer, they did not sufficiently attend
to a poor blind man. Charles observed
this neglect; Father, said he, let me
assist you, and he cut his meat for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>I find the treat was more acceptable to
the poor than the rich—I will ever try
to recollect, that it is more delightful
to give pleasure, than excite admiration.</p>

<p class='c005'>We rode out yesterday, and had not
the pleasure we expected. When we
left home the weather was fine; but the
sky soon began to lower, and the rain
fell in large drops; we were obliged to
gallop to a little farm-house, and wait
there till the storm was over. Edward
was grumbling all the way, and Emilia
was low-spirited, and I own I was disappointed;
Charles looked so for a moment,
but soon recollected himself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is dreadful.—What a pity it is—the
rain will prevent our enjoying any
pleasure.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No; we can drink tea here, and return
home when it clears up.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is not so pleasant. I wish it
was fair now—I want to have a ride.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You wish it was dry weather to pursue
your ride to please yourself: and
our neighbour, the farmer, wished this
morning for rain, because the plants
and grass are almost withered by the
drought. Whose wish is most rational?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The farmer’s, I think.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Every day there are some parties of
pleasure, and could the selfish wish for
fair weather prevail, our fields would
soon lose their verdure, and the corn
cease to swell, till it becomes a laughing
image of plenty. The fruits would drop
dry on the ground, and the flowers no
longer perfume the air. You will see
how green every thing will look, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>how sweet they will smell as we return
home.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will never impatiently complain of
the rain again.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And I still continue to wish it had
not rained till night.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They who have to travel to-night,
would wish to put it off till to-morrow.
Whose wish is to be gratified?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Charles is right. We are in God’s
sight, no more than other men.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to know what to wish
for at all times.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Believe me, Dr. Bartlett has convinced
me, we should be miserable, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>God always gave us what we desire.
And, dear sister, is our pleasure for a
day to be compared with the good that
so many will experience from the rain?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>

<p class='c006'>But the poor birds, I pity them.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They will take shelter if it is troublesome
to them. Besides, their feathers
have a kind of oil in them, which hinders
them from being wet.</p>

<p class='c005'>As it did not seem likely to clear up,
we seized the first moment, between the
showers, and hastened home. Charles
gave his sister his canary-bird, and she
went to provide a cage for it. We diverted
ourselves; but Edward was out
of humour; complained of the weather,
and tormented his poor dog.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I cannot forbear relating to you,
my dear mother, what happened here
last night. We had scarcely been in
bed half an hour, before we heard a
dreadful noise. What is that, said
Charles? I do not know, answered I,
but I am afraid somebody is breaking
into the house. We listened, and the
moment after heard Edward cry out.
Charles jumped immediately out of bed,
and I followed him; he caught up the
poker and the candle, and lighted it at
the lamp on the staircase. We almost
flew to Edward’s room, where the noise
came from. Charles shewed not the
least sign of fear; but I could not help
trembling exceedingly. Coming into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Edward’s chamber we found him lying
on the ground, and the table fallen
topsy turvy, and all the books and things
on the floor. What has happened? asked
Charles. Heaven knows; but I am
terribly frightened, replied Edward. We
both eagerly enquired how he came on
the ground, and why he had cried out
so dreadfully?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You would probably have cried out
too—I do not know how I got out of
bed—this room is haunted.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You frightened me at first; but now
I must laugh. Poor William was almost
frightened to death; I will go and
look for a bottle of wine, it is proper
you should both take a glass.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do not go alone!—call one of the
servants.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Let the servants sleep; I could not
call them without disturbing my mother,
and I would avoid doing that, as
there is not any real cause for fear.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And dare you go alone?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Why not, my friend, I am sure there
are no thieves in the house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have as much courage as he—yet,
William, I would not go down. Hush!
pray listen—do you hear any thing?
Here comes Charles—what have you
seen? Surely, you must have met something.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes; I have seen the stairs, the
dining-room, and this bottle and glass.
Come on, let us drink each a glass, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>it will give us courage to wait for the
apparition.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I beg you will not make game of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And why not?—It is only at apparitions
I laugh.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Why, do you believe that there are
no apparitions?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Indeed I do not give credit to the
stories I have been told lately; my father
would never allow such subjects to
be mentioned when I was a child. But,
Edward, tell me now what made you
so suddenly get out of bed?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An apparition, I tell you, Charles.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps you were dreaming?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A likely story truly—I think I know
when I am awake.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And what did you see then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I had just put out my candle, and before
I could fall asleep, I plainly heard
something run across the chamber. I
then started up in bed and saw in the
farther corner two lights, they moved
about, and sometimes appeared very small
and then glared like large balls.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That was certainly no more than a
glittering in your eyes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What?—What I saw so clearly?—I
then kept myself quite still—the light
vanished, and I heard a great bounce
against the door.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>WILLIAM.</div>

<p class='c006'>I should have been frightened, I am
sure.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I was so terrified I could not call for
a light, I sunk into the bed and covered
my head; but I had not remained
many moments, scarcely daring to
breathe, when I heard a light foot-step
coming towards the side of my bed next
the wall;—I ventured to peep—and saw,
indeed I did, a great white apparition,
which grew bigger and bigger as it approached:—I
know not what I did—I
jumped out of the other side of the bed,
knocked down the table, and screamed
out.—But hush, I hear a noise.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will lay a wager it is a rat that has
hid itself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A rat is not white.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Let us search, something it must be;
a spirit cannot make a noise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Charles then looked in every corner
of the room, behind the clothes-press,
and the bureau. He then called out,
there is the apparition, Edward, I have
found it at last. And what was it, do
you think? A great white cat which
generally lives in the stable. We all
laughed, in particular Edward; but,
said he, I cannot imagine how the cat
could make such a noise, and look so
big.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Your fear magnified it; when we are
terrified, we seldom see things as they
really are. The lights, which were the
cat’s eyes, so dazzled yours, you imagined
them to be balls of fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>We then went to bed and slept very
sound till the morning.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>We related the whole affair when we
were at breakfast, and after Sir Charles
had commended his son, he added, This
may teach you all not to be terrified,
but to enquire into things; and believe
me, many causes, which at first appeared
very alarming, will vanish, or only
resemble the white cat. While God,
the great Spirit, takes care of us, can
phantoms harm us? He will support all
those who trust in him—fear him—and
you may banish every other fear. You
may be certain, all the stories you have
heard, took their rise from terror; a
timid disturbed imagination created the
spectre, or swelled some slight reality
into one: none had the courage to search
for the truth, or it eluded the search.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall never forget this incident, dear
mother; I recollect what Charles said,
a spirit cannot make a noise. The stories
I have been told in Holland, I now
think foolish; the tall woman, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>walked in the grove at night, and the
white monster, almost as high as the
steeple, and many others of the same
kind, I am sure would be found, on enquiry,
to resemble the tale of the white
cat, which Edward would have told, if
Charles had not dragged the supposed
spirit from its hiding place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yesterday, after we had finished
our exercises, Charles asked me to take
a walk in the garden, and, seeing Dr.
Bartlett, we hastened to join him; for
indeed we both like to hear him talk,
and try to profit by his instructions,
which are delivered in such a familiar

him with a book in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>We waited silent a few moments, and
then Dr. Bartlett put his book into his

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Look, Sir, what insects are those
which fly in such multitudes about the
fish-pond?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They are ants.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Have ants wings?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, they obtain wings for some time
during this season of the year. And
what appears the most wonderful, is,
that they are thus winged in a very
few moments.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a pity that these insects are so
destructive to the productions of the
earth, I like them so well for their diligence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When they are together, they are as
one family. They build themselves a
city, which is divided into several streets.
They have each of them separate employments;
one digs a hole in the earth,
another sweeps the earth away, and a
third brings grass or stubble to make
the hole warm and dry, that they may
preserve their eggs and their young from
the cold and damp. Their labour to
provide themselves food is wonderful:
they are so industrious they will go to a
great distance for it, and returning, always
keep in a direct road, seldom mistaking
it, though far from their own
habitation. They take great care not
to run in each others way; and are so
very sagacious, that when they are
obliged to carry any thing very heavy,
from an eminence, they let it fall with
deliberation, and take it up again when
they arrive at the bottom.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But, Sir, I have often seen that they
are continually moving their young and
their eggs.—Why do they disturb them
so frequently?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They do this, when they find it either
damp or cold; for they take uncommon
care of their little ones. After
rain they bring their eggs into the open
air to let them dry, lest the young, which
are in them, should perish; and if the
rain is very heavy they remove the earth
with their feet, and cover them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Poor creatures!—We give them,
thoughtlessly, much unnecessary trouble.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They are very injurious, and their use
is not apparent;—why then did God
create them? I should think there must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>be some hidden reason, which we cannot
dive into, or even get a glance to
direct our search.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You do well to reason in this manner.
Who can pretend to fathom the secrets
of the Most High, or circumscribe his
ways? All that is necessary to direct our
search after virtue, is found by those,
who seek for it, as for hid treasure:
questions, that mere wanton curiosity
dictates, are left doubtful, or discovered
by chance. The knowledge of them
is not essential to our earthly comfort;
though modest enquiries into the operations
of nature, will ennoble our minds,
and raise us above grovelling pursuits.
We must first labour for the one thing
needful:—if we are good here, we shall
be wiser hereafter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will try to remember what you have
said, Sir.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But speaking of the ants brings to
my remembrance some other creatures,
that are still more skilful, I mean the
beavers. How would you both be
astonished, could I show you the habitations
these wonderful creatures make!
No experienced builder could form them
better. They first choose a very healthful
situation, and where there is plenty
of provision, near a fresh stream of water;
and then raise an eminence with
great labour and dispatch. For this
purpose they dig out the earth and clay
with their fore feet, and carry their burdens
on their tails (which nature has
made a little hollow like a shovel) to
the place they have chosen for their
abode. With their teeth they cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>with great expedition through trees as
thick as my arm; and these piles they
work into the ground to form a firm
foundation. Then they begin to build
a house, which consists of three stories,
one above another; the walls are perpendicular,
and more than a foot thick.
It is within very neat, of a round form,
and has an arched roof. The size in
proportion to the number of the family
that is to reside in it: for example, they
allow fourteen or fifteen feet for twelve
beavers. What think you of such creatures?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I am astonished, Sir; I wish I could
once see these architects. In what country
are they to be found?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They are to be found in Germany,
and in Poland, along the rivers; but
chiefly in Canada.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>May I ask what sort of creatures these
are?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They are amphibious; so we name
those creatures which can live either on
land or in the water. The head is larger
than a rat’s; their fore feet are short, and
with these they hold fast their food; their
hind feet are long, and with a web betwixt
the claws, like the ducks; and their
tails are flat and finny, and assist them
to swim with more ease than they could
do, if they only used their feet for that
purpose.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But of what materials do they build
the thick walls of their houses?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They mix and knead together, with
their fore feet, clay, earth and water;
and their tails serve first as a mortar-tray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>to carry it, and then as a trowel to
plaister it on in a proper manner.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is wonderful! But can these skilful
creatures work without the least reflection?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They have not thinking powers, of
course they cannot deliberate about it.
God has created them with a certain
ability or instinct to direct them infallibly.
Man is a superior animal, he
only in this world is endued with the
noble power of reflection.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This preference demands our gratitude.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>DR. BARTLETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Certainly, my dear, demands our utmost
diligence to cultivate the precious
gift. We ought never to speak or act
without reflection, and our whole conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>should be conformable to the wise
designs of the Creator:—this is the only
way to make ourselves worthy of our
dignity. The Doctor then left us.</p>

<p class='c005'>I preserve in my mind all these good
instructions, dear mother; never, no
never, shall I forget them. And as God
has made us capable of reasoning, if we
abuse this goodness, and act without
understanding, we are not above the
senseless brutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a pity, I acknowledge; but you
are not to grieve for the loss of a bird,
as if you had lost a parent. You have
lost a plaything, not a friend; it gave
you pleasure, excited your tenderness,

any new favourite will supply its place.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had, as I often did, let the bird out
of the cage to eat out of my hand. My
mamma sent for me, I went to her for a
moment, and in the mean time, the
maid had let the cat slip into the chamber,
who instantly seized and devoured
my poor little creature. I shall never
forgive myself for not putting it into its
cage. And as to the careless maid, I
hope my mother will soon part with her.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>She did not do it on purpose, I am

    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And why? The cat cannot help it,
it is its nature to catch birds and mice;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>you would correct her for following an
instinct which renders her a useful domestic.
If you had beat her the very
moment after the accident, it might have
restrained her in future; but by this
time she has forgot it, and consequently
it would be cruel. You cannot get your
bird again by indulging a spirit of revenge;
you must console yourself.</p>

<p class='c005'>You are a comfort to me, my son,
and Annette deserves my tender affection,
she is so tractable and good. Your letters
improve and please her; she requests
me to read them twenty times over, that
she may remember them. The tears
were in her eyes when I read what you
had written concerning the canary-bird.
Poor Emilia, said she, how I do pity
her. It gives me pleasure, replied I,
that you participate in your friend’s
grief; it is a sign that you have a good
heart, and deserve the sympathy of
others: mutual affection is necessary, it
softens affliction. Indeed I have experienced
it, mamma, answered she, that is,
I have never been so much vexed at any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>thing, when I saw somebody pitied me,
as when they laughed at me.—And I
love those people who have compassion,
they look so good-natured.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, William, I must give you a caution.
The beginning of your letter was
too alarming, it startled me; I thought
at least that Emilia had been dreadfully
hurt; if she had lost an eye or a limb
it could not have shocked me more.
You might have expressed your pity, as
she was grieved, but not in such terms;
what other words could you have used,
had she lost her mother? Learn in future,
when a thing of the same kind
occurs, to be more cautious how you
write, and do not confound proper feelings;
nor even the expressions, which
should convey to others a notion of what
passes in your mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>I send you by this opportunity, some
pocket-money, I wish I could afford to
send you more, as you deserve it; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Lady Grandison informs me, that you
are very careful, and try to make your
clothes last long. In you this attention
is a virtue, as you do it not only to spare
your mother, whose circumstances are
confined, but to have money to give to
the poor. The œconomy and self-denial,
which flows from such motives, is so
laudable, that I hope the foolish sneers
of thoughtless young people, will never
make you think yourself mean-spirited,
as they will call you: those only can be
called mean, in the true sense of the
word, who save to gratify their appetites.
Write often, your conversations
please me, and I mentioned before, that
they improved Annette.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I must give you another proof of the
virtue and wisdom of my friend Charles.
Yesterday, when we had done our lessons,
for we never neglect them, we went to
the wood, to take our pleasure, and found
it very pleasant; but the thickness of
the trees prevented our seeing a heavy
storm that was approaching, till a violent
peal of thunder made us jump.
Emilia is very much afraid of thunder.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Brother, it thunders—what shall I
do?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do not terrify yourself, there is no
cause for fear; it is only the natural
consequence of great heat, and the weather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>lately has been very warm. We
will return home, it is right to leave the
trees, they attract the lightning.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I dare not stir—O if I was but in the
house, in the cellar!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And what would you do in the cellar,
is it not God who directs the storm?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then he can preserve you every where;
here, in the house, or the cellar, it is
all the same; but still we are to exercise
our reason while we trust in God: let
us then leave the trees, they are dangerous.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But who can tell that God will preserve
me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Does he not give you daily proofs of
his favour? You would be miserable if
he did not guard you. Where would
you be safe? There is no need of a storm
to destroy us, we are every moment in
danger, if we lose his protection. A
chimney, or only a tile may fall on us
from a house:—there are a thousand
things which we have reason to be afraid
of, if we fear any. Dr. Bartlett says,
he only fears offending God.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are a foolish girl, to be afraid of
thunder. Come let us play and sing,
then the noise will not reach us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No, we can play and sing, when the
storm is over. It is not now the time
when God lets us see such an astonishing
token of his almighty Power—let
us view the tempest with reverence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Oh, what a loud clap of thunder!
May not that be a sign that God is angry
with us?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No surely. This stormy weather is
a blessing; it is of use to purify the air:
the heat of the summer would, without
these concussions, occasion a great many
contagious disorders. Emilia, be easy,
God loves us, we every day receive proofs
of it; let us trust in him, as we trust
our parents;—we cannot doubt their
love, and have we less reliance on our
heavenly Father?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Come, let us hasten into the house;
my father said once, it was dangerous
to look at the lightning.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Except an extraordinary flash, it has
much the same effect as when you look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>at the sun, the sight is immediately
dimmed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do not go home, how can you be so
foolish?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Though I do not fear the storm myself,
I would not be so ill-natured as to
oblige Emilia to stand trembling here.
I would avoid, without despising her
weakness. It is weak to be afraid, but
impious to mock the storm.</p>

<p class='c005'>We then hastened home; and soon
after the sky cleared up, and I quickly
saw that the thunder had been of use;
the air was cool, and every herb and
flower revived, the garden was more fragrant
than usual.</p>

<p class='c006'>I thank you, dear mother, for the
money you have sent me. You say it
is little, but I think it much. My
thanks are due to you, for I am certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>you scarcely allow yourself necessaries,
to enable me to appear properly in this
family; I feel your goodness, and will
do my utmost to improve by the opportunity,
and always remember the sacrifice
my mother has made, and the affection
she has ever shewn me. Dr. Bartlett
frequently mentions this circumstance,
when we are alone; but my memory
does not need refreshing—I love
my mother, and long to tell her that I
am her grateful and dutiful son.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Judge of the good heart of Emilia;
an accident yesterday made it appear to
advantage. She was in the parlour with
Edward, playing on the harpsicord; after
she had finished the tune, she went
to look for a china flower-pot in a china-closet
near the parlour. She found what
she wanted; but still loitered, looking
at the china; and one jar she would
reach from a high shelf, though Edward
cautioned her: the consequence
was, it fell out of her hand, and was
dashed to pieces. She trembled, well
knowing it was a jar of great value.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mighty well, you would look at the
china.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do not scold me, I am so sorry; rather
give me your advice.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I can give you no advice; if you
sought every where you could not find
such another jar to match the one which
is left. Why did you touch it? you
must always be meddling, you are so
curious.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will never be curious again, I assure
you. I know I have done wrong.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now hear me, do not cry; I will
tell you what you may do. Nobody
has heard it, we will take the pieces
and put them together behind a dish;
and to-morrow, all of a sudden, you
may say you have heard something fall
in the closet; then go and look, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Lady Grandison will think the cat threw
it down, or some other accident made
it fall.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No, Edward,—that I will never do;
it would be much worse than breaking
it through idle curiosity.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What will you do then? your mother
will be displeased.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I would sooner bear her displeasure a
week, than tell such a falsehood. Hear
me, I will go to her, confess my fault;
and indeed I shall be more careful for
the future.</p>

<p class='c005'>She then ran trembling to her mother;
but how was she astonished, when
the good Lady spoke kindly to her. If
you had broken all my china by accident,
my child, I should not have chid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>you; your foolish curiosity was blameable;
but your attention to truth has
more than atoned for it: I find I can
rely on your veracity. She kissed her
mother’s hand, and returned to tell us
what had happened. Edward looked
ashamed, and said, he would never advise
such an artifice again, he should not
like to deceive such a kind Lady, or
lose her good opinion. Charles could
not help saying, when we tell a lie we
offer an affront to God. Dr. Bartlett
often observes, he is ever present, and
abhors a liar.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Oh! my dear mother, we are all here
full of anxiety; Charles, who went very
early this morning on horseback, with
one of the servants, to pay Mr. Friendly
a visit, and promised to return early,
is not yet come home; and it is past
nine o’clock. He was always punctual—some
misfortune must have befallen
him.—I do not know what to think, or
fear. The night is very dark, and the
weather stormy. Sir Charles has just
sent off a servant to obtain some information:—how
we all long for his return!</p>

<p class='c006'>Eleven o’clock. The servant is come
back; but no intelligence of Charles.
He left Mr. Friendly’s soon after dinner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>about four o’clock. Dear mother,
where can he be? Drowned, I fear:—perhaps—perhaps
what? I am afraid
even to write the strange thoughts and
conjectures which come into my head—I
never seemed so much alive before, my
soul feels as if it would fly out of my
body to search for Charles—dear Charles!
Lady Grandison sits silent; Emilia does
nothing but cry; and Edward runs
through the house quite frantic: Sir
Charles endeavours to comfort his Lady,
and has need of comfort himself. He
has sent several servants different ways,
and waits impatiently for day-break,
when he intends going himself.—O that
he would take me with him!</p>

<p class='c006'>One o’clock, and no news of Charles.
We are none of us in bed—and indeed
who could sleep! My eyes feel as if
they would never close again—I cannot
cry.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Half after four. Thank Heaven—Charles
is safe. The servant, who attended
him, is just arrived. It was not
his fault, that we had so much uneasiness;
no pleasure—no company detained
him.—But Sir Charles insists on it,
that we go to bed for a few hours. I
cannot sleep, though I must go to bed.—I
do not want sleep, Charles is safe.
Why does my joy make me cry? I did
not weep when I thought I should never,
O never see him more.—Well, I must go
to this same bed.—Good morning to
you, Madam. I declare the birds are
beginning to sing—how can I sleep?</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Now you shall hear the servant’s account—I
long to tell you all about an
affair, which is to clear my friend;—for
a moment you must not think ill of
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles set out from Mr. Friendly’s
soon after dinner, Harry, his man, of
course attended him. The weather had
been all day lowering; they quickened
their pace; but such a thick mist arose
gradually, they could scarcely see two
yards before them. Charles, though
he is very courageous, shewed some
signs of fear, and they then rode slowly,
observing every step, when they saw at
some little distance, a man lying in the
middle of the road. What is that? said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Charles, holding-in his horse. A man
who has drank more than he ought, I
suppose, answered Harry. Pray, Sir,
ride a little quicker, it grows late. No,
replied Charles, for if the man is drunk,
we must endeavour to help him out of
the highway, or he may be rode over
in the dark. Saying so, he jumped off
his horse: but how terrifying was the
sight!—He saw an old officer lying weltering
in his blood. He spoke to him;
but received no answer. The gentleman
is dead, cried Harry. No, no, interrupted
Charles, he has only fainted
through loss of blood. What shall we
do? What can we do? replied Harry.
Let us gallop on to the first village to
procure assistance. What, and leave
the man bleeding, said Charles, with
warmth; he would die before we could
even reach the village.—Do you not see
how he bleeds? Tie our horses fast to that
tree, and make haste to assist me, I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>not let a man die without doing my best
to save him. He then pulled off his
clothes, and tore his shirt; and finding
that the wound was in the head, he
wiped away the gore, and bound the
linen round it; he did it several times
before he could stop the effusion. After
the operation, they lifted him cautiously,
and laid him on the grass, near
the road side. Good heavens, said Harry,
it begins to be quite dark, and the mist
is so thick, we shall never be able to
find our way; and how uneasy they will
all be at home. O that is true, said
Charles; come, let us go.—And he advanced
a step or two; but turning his
eyes on the poor officer, they filled with
tears, and he stood thinking half a moment—and
then burst out.—No, I cannot,
will not leave you in this condition;
I do not occasion the uneasiness
my parents will feel to gratify myself;
I ought not to deliberate a moment:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>ride on directly to the next village, or
to the first cottage you spy, and prevail
on some man to return with you; and
all together we may carry this poor man
to a shelter, and procure further help.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>HARRY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I dare not leave you here alone, your
father would never forgive me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Heaven will preserve me; and as to
the blame, I will take care it shall not
fall on you. I tell you, if you will not
go, I will go myself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Harry did not wait to expostulate any
more, but did as he was ordered; and
fortunately soon reached a little farm-house,
which they might have seen from the
road, had it been a clear night. He
went in and told the case to the man
who lived there, and begged him and
his son immediately to go with him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>The farmer at first seemed reluctant, he
was tired, and just preparing to go to
bed, after a hard day’s work; but when
Harry told him he should be well recompensed,
he fetched a sort of handbarrow,
and laid a mattrass on it, and
followed to the place. Before they reached
it, Charles had the satisfaction to see
the officer open his eyes, and come gradually
to himself; and looking wistfully
at Charles, he said, falteringly, Who
are you, young man, who thus alone,
this dismal night, supports my wounded
head? Did you bind this linen round
my temples? I have been so happy, replied
Charles, as to arrive in time to be
of service to you; I had a servant with
me, but I have sent him for further
assistance, that you may be removed to
some house. What reflection, what fortitude!
faintly cried the weak man.—Do
not exhaust yourself, Sir, interrupted
Charles; I have only done my duty—indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>my heart bled for you, I could
not have left you. Harry and the men
that moment joined them; they all assisted,
and laid the officer on the handbarrow;
but the fatigue was too much
for him, and he fainted again through
weakness. They walked very slow, and
at length brought him into the cottage;
and Charles sent the farmer for a surgeon.
And what is now your intention?
asked Harry. To stay here this
night, replied Charles; I cannot think
of leaving this venerable old man with
strangers, who do not seem the most
humane people in the world. Do you
hasten home, and tell them what has
happened, and then I shall wait with
comfort till to-morrow, and see myself
that the poor man is properly attended—I
will be his nurse. Harry was not
willing to leave him; but he spoke in
such a positive tone of voice, Harry
thought it vain to attempt to dissuade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>him; so, much against his inclination,
he rode away; and would certainly have
relieved us soon from all our anxiety, if
the thick fog, and his vexation together,
had not made him lose, or mistake
the short by-road, which leads directly
through the wood to the house; he
wandered about till the first peep of
dawn, and then entered the parlour
trembling. We had all our eyes and
mouths open, ready to catch the news—and
we began to ask so many questions
in a breath, Sir Charles was obliged to
command silence, that we might hear
the account. He praised the servant,
gave him a guinea, and desired him to
go to bed for an hour or two, and then
come to him, before he returned to his
son, to whom he would send a message,
and some money to enable him to pay
the surgeon, and supply the wants of
the invalide.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>But how will the tender heart of my
friend suffer, when he hears what we
have endured. Lady Grandison went to
bed very ill; but, I hope, she is now
better; I have not seen her this morning.
I long to know if the poor officer
is alive or dead.</p>

your fellow-creature without forgetting

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have not left him alone with them,
his own son is now with him. As soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>as the old gentleman recovered his recollection,
he mentioned his place of
abode, which was not very distant. I
sent to inform his children of the accident;
and his eldest son set off immediately,
and soon arrived at the cottage.
When I had committed him into the
hands of his son, I was eager to return
home to my parents.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You were right, your presence was

man means to provide himself with what
is requisite in his weak state?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, I enquired, and find he is in
very good circumstances. Did I do right,
Sir? I only rewarded the farmer, and
gave Harry a trifle: and now I will return
the remainder of the money you
sent me.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>SIR CHARLES.</div>

<p class='c006'>You may keep it, and distribute it as

    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Believe me, I thought little of myself,
I had before me a dying old man—I
could think of nothing else. I desired
some clean straw to be laid, near the
sick man’s bed, but I made no use of it.
My uneasiness on your account, and my
painful anxiety for the officer, banished
sleep from my eyes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<p class='c006'>I should have slept on that as well as
in my bed, if my heart had been at
ease.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Charles is right; it is peace of mind
and health of body which procures that
refreshing sleep so necessary to recruit
our exhausted powers. The softest bed
will not afford rest to a troubled mind,
or a disordered body.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Who knows, when I am in the army,
how many nights I may be obliged to
sleep on the ground, without even the
straw Emilia despises.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That may happen; and before young
people make choice of a profession, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>should arm themselves against the inconveniences,
which consequently attend
it: always remembering, that every
state of life has its pains and pleasures.
Every station is eligible, and will afford
us heart-felt joy, if we fill it conscientiously:
it is about our conduct, not
our situation, that we should bestow
most thought; and be more anxious
to avoid evil than pain.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I dare say, the king himself has his
cares and sorrows as well as the meanest
of his subjects.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Certainly. He is a man, none are
exempt; God is no respecter of persons;
they please him, who do good,
and attend to truth: it matters not whether
it be in a palace, or a mud hovel.</p>

<p class='c005'>When we were alone, Charles said, I
knew my father would not be displeased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>with me; yet if it had been possible, I
wished not only to have spared him the
anxiety my absence occasioned, but to
have asked his advice. I followed the
impulse of my heart—yet I do it with
more pleasure, when his sanction assures
me my feelings do not lead my reason
astray.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I have another proof to give you,
my honoured mother, of the goodness
of heart Charles continually exhibits.
A gentleman, who visits very frequently
this family, made him a present of a
beautiful spaniel; young Falkland, our
neighbour, had often asked for it; but
the gentleman refused to give him it,
because he treats his own dogs cruelly.
You must know, Falkland has already
five dogs, besides cats, pigeons,
and a parrot. These afford him his
chief employment; not to make them
happy, but to please himself. Though
he has so many, he was very much
vexed that he could not get this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>dog. And what do you think happened?
The dog died suddenly, and we
have by chance discovered that Falkland
made one of his servants poison the poor
animal.—What monsters there are in the
world! Yes, he must be a monster, I
think, who deprives another of a pleasure
when he receives no benefit from
it himself. But the following conversation,
when we were walking in the
garden, soon after the discovery, will
let you see how Charles behaves, even
when he is angry.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I cannot help grieving about the poor
dog.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I acknowledge I am very sorry; I did
not think that the loss of a dog would
have affected me in such a manner;—but
it was a very faithful one—and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the horrid agonies it endured—I cannot
forget its groans.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was a villainous action of Falkland
to destroy that poor beast in such a manner.—If
it had happened to me, I could
never forgive him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I can.—If I could not forgive him, I
should be as wicked as himself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are too good. I, for my part,
hate him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I do not hate him, but I despise his
vices;—and I pity him, for it is much
to be feared he will become a bad man;
an envious cruel heart seldom reforms
itself, Dr. Bartlett says.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yesterday you called that treacherous
fellow friend;—you see you are sometimes
mistaken.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I am apt to be mistaken in this particular;
it is so pleasant to love and
think well of people.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But will you any longer keep up the
acquaintance?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No, certainly, without my father desires
it; I should with difficulty conceal
my dislike—it was such a mean action.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Bravo! Now you speak to my mind;
and, if you like it, I will give him a
good drubbing.—Say yes, and I will
make his bones ache.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That would not give me back my
poor dog.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will tell you what—he has five
dogs, let us poison some of them; that
he deserves at least.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But those poor dogs—what have they
done?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I am curious to know, what my uncle
will say of this pretty trick; he has
always spoken slightingly of young Falkland.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is a sign he could penetrate into
his mind, and saw his bad temper. I
will, in future, pay more attention to
his advice, and observations on characters.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>But now I think of it, Edward,
we will not tell my father that Falkland
poisoned my dog. Let us try to make
him feel ashamed, by shewing him we
despise revenge—I should like to mortify
him this way.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are very generous.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Let us talk of something else—my
dog is dead, I will try to make myself
easy—I wish I could forget the torments
it endured.—It is a very fine evening.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Look, look! What do I see yonder
in that tree?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a parrot.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How fortunate!—It is Falkland’s parrot;
it has flown away from him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>perched itself there: it looks frightened.
How vexed he will be—he should
not have that creature again for ten
guineas.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How the poor creature trembles.—I
can climb softly up the tree and catch
it;—do not make a noise.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And so you will send it to Falkland
again, to please him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No, for something else.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He has killed your dog, and you will
allow his favourite parrot to live when
it is in your power. I think it mean-spirited.—Can
you have a better opportunity
to revenge yourself on that rascal?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, I can take a more noble revenge;
by returning good for evil, I shall let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>him see how much I am his superior:
and that will highly gratify me.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately Charles mounted the
tree, and caught the bird, whose feet
were entangled in the branches. He
then sent it by a servant to Falkland—and
returned to us with a smiling face;
I hardly ever saw so much satisfaction in
his countenance: and when Edward still
continued to laugh at him, he replied,
I felt pleasure in returning good for
evil, my pride impelled me to act thus,
as well as a sense of duty; I do not pretend
to any great merit in conquering
one feeling to gratify another, but I
should have been inexcusable if I had
tormented an innocent helpless bird,
merely to vex a being I despise. Nay,
my anger would have been mean and selfish;
I should only resent the loss of my
dog, and not feel indignation on account
of the vices this loss has forced me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>discover in a character I was partial to.
I shall forget my dog, long before I
shall be able to drive from my remembrance
a cruel action done by a fellow-creature.
Charles looked teased, and
Edward ceased to blame him,—and I
tried to amuse him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>We had yesterday a whole day of
pleasure, gathering the winter fruits.
The gardener and his son climbed into
the high trees, and plucked the apples
and pears from the heavy laden branches;
and we held the baskets to save them
from being bruised, for those that fall
to the ground will not keep. Some
country girls had been observing our
employment; and one of them spoke to
Harry, eagerly looking at the apples.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What does that girl want?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>HARRY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>She desires me to ask you for some
apples for a sick mother; and I know
the poor woman has been a long time
ill.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For a sick mother?—she is a good
child, go give her as many as she can
carry; let her have some for herself as well
as her mother.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>HARRY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Shall I give her some of these small
ones, which are not of a very good
kind?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How—would you give the sick what
is not good? No, she shall have some
of them I gathered just now; they grew
on my own tree, and the branches were
bent down with the weight of the fruit.
My tree never bore so much before; let
me give part of my abundance to those
who have none.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I do not blame you, Charles; but those
common people are always asking
for something.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If they did not ask they would seldom
get any thing. Dear Edward, we ask
daily of God; permit then at least that
those industrious people ask of us, who
are made of the same materials, and in
whose veins the same blood flows. It
is as much our duty to spare part of our
superfluities to relieve their accidental
distress; as it is theirs to work to supply
their daily wants.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And we should not, in any degree,
merit the abundance we enjoy, if we refused
to give a part of it to the poor. I
will tell my mother, and I am sure she
will send more than a basket of apples to
the sick woman, and the good daughter
who takes care of her.</p>

<p class='c005'>When we returned, Sir Charles, after
looking at the fruit, said, How wise and
good is God, who thus provides for our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>comfort and pleasure. The fruits of the
earth, which ought only to be ate in
warm weather, perish as the winter comes
on; but these wholesome dainties may
be preserved to cheer us when the earth
ceases to bring forth, and the leaves die
on the boughs. How many persons are
daily eating the provisions, the different
seasons afford, and forget to thank the
Giver, forget to imitate him, by imparting
part of the blessings which are
so liberally bestowed.—You read the
parable of the man, who, instead of
opening his heart, when his stores increased,
was for pulling down his barns
and building more capacious ones; but
that very night his soul was required to
quit the body he had pampered. He
who dwelleth in heaven laugheth to
scorn the designs of the proud; and
frustrates the plans of the foolish
man, who tries to provide for years to
come, when he is not certain, that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>shall many hours be permitted to breathe
the breath of life. They only enjoy
life, who fear not death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just now Sir Charles has received a
letter from Lady M——, requesting him
to permit Charles to visit his uncle, Lord
M——, who has been some time in a
declining state of health. To-morrow
my friend departs with Dr. Bartlett; I
shall long for his return, every place
will appear so dull when he is gone;
but he has promised to write to me, and
I will send you his letters, and take care of
them, that I may read them again when
I come home—for they then will be all
I shall have of Charles—I hate these
partings. Farewell.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>We have had a tedious journey, dear
William. Foolish ignorant people would
say it foreboded no good; but we have
been better instructed, and have not been
allowed to catch those weak prejudices,
which, my  tutor says, produce more
than half the ills of life; and are a
greater weight on the spirits, than the
real unavoidable evils.</p>

<p class='c006'>Well, now for a full and true account
of all our disasters. When we
came to the second stage, we could not
get fresh horses; and those we had were
scarcely able to drag the chaise. One
lagged, and the other very unwillingly
tried to get into its old pace; yet,
though any human creature, I should
have thought, would have pitied them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the postilion gave them lash after lash,
till my patience was quite exhausted,
and I remonstrated with him: indeed
the strokes went to my heart; and I
felt as if I had rather have called the
horse my brother, than the wretch who
treated him with such barbarity, who,
whistling, turned his unmoved face to
me, while he smacked his whip. I
soon perceived that the harness had galled
one of the horses; well might it
winch, poor wretch!—at last it tottered,
and fell. The postilion again began
to use his whip; but we interposed; I
could not help asking him if he had any
bowels? He stared at me, and said, fine
talking, it is only rust, it must be beat
out of him. Ah! my dear friend, of
what use is a good education? this man
seemed so thoughtless, as not even to
know he was cruel: my anger was turned
into compassion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>We waited a short time, but we soon
found the horses could not draw us to
the next stage. There was no remedy
or alternative, we must walk till we
could meet with a house, or remain in
the chaise till Harry could bring another.
Dr. Bartlett determined to walk,
though it was a very wet evening, and
to leave Harry not only to take care of
the luggage, but to prevent the postilion
from exercising wanton cruelty on the
fallen beast. We walked in the rain,
along a very bad road; but I should not
have minded these trifling inconveniences,
if Dr. Bartlett had not been exposed
to them—it was far better than
hearing the lashes resound on the horse’s
side; and seeing the look of patient anguish,
which the poor animal cast on
the driver—indeed I cannot forget it.</p>

<p class='c006'>We hastened forward; but the rain
was so heavy, we were wet through before
we reached a little farm on a common.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>This little abode, stolen from
the waste, said my tutor, will afford us
a shelter. A cheerful light, which
darted through a window, no shutter
guarded, seemed to invite us to house
ourselves, and we knocked with our
sticks against the door; it was quickly
opened, and a venerable old man, bending
beneath a weight of years, desired
us to enter, and in the chimney corner
we saw an old woman, sitting near the
blazing hearth, whose light had attracted
us; and a girl was preparing some
cabbages for their supper. We mentioned
our accident to account for our
intrusion, and while we were speaking
the old woman stirred the fire and desired
us to approach and dry ourselves.
We did so.—What a refreshment! Never,
no never did I find the fire so comfortable
as at that moment. What a
blessing it is, thought I, that there is
so much fewel—and what must those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>suffer, who, wet and numbed, cannot
procure a fire to dry their rags, or warm
their shivering limbs; I now feel for
them more than ever. I looked at the inside
of the cottage with some attention;
what a difference there is between
it and our elegant house, thought I, and
yet the old couple seem to be bent by
years not care. The rich have luxury
and listlessness, the poor labour and repose,
whispered the Doctor, when I
mentioned to him the doubts which
were struggling in my mind; God is
still the Father of us all, and provides
for all his numerous family.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gentlemen, said the old man, though
I cannot give you much good cheer, you
are welcome to what I have. My
daughter will fry some bacon and eggs,
to help out the cabbage, and I believe I
can find a bottle of strong beer.—What
say you, Dame, is there not one saved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>for Christmas? We must bring it out
of its hiding place for the gentlemen;
for after being wet they will want
something to comfort their hearts. And
our bed too is at your service. Dr. Bartlett
refused the bed, because he would
not put them to any inconvenience; but
they insisted on it, and said, they could
sleep in the loft, in their daughter’s bed,
who would not matter lying on the floor
one night; and for matter of that, said
the old man, I should not mind doing
so one night myself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whilst the cloth was laying, and the
girl was a long time placing two knives
and forks and a broken saltcellar, we
got into conversation, and the Doctor
observing she did not put any more on
the table, told his host, we must all
sup together, and drink sociably the
Christmas ale. If you desire it, master,
replied he, it shall be done, for though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>you be pretty spoken gentlemen, I
thought, mayhap, you might be too
proud to eat with poor folks; no offence,
I hope, if I speaks my mind:—Old
John is fond of plain-dealing, when
there is neither sin nor shame in it.—The
old woman gave his sleeve a pull;
she thought she understood good-breeding,
for she had been several times in
’Squire Anderson’s kitchen, and madam’s
own woman had spoken to her.
The supper stopped our mouths, and a
friendly one it was, I never eat any thing
with such an appetite—I believe the bacon
and eggs were remarkably good. I
did not want a variety of dishes to coax
my palate, I assure you.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ale made John talk, and tell us
many droll stories, nor could dame stop
him, though she trod on his toes, and
winked significantly. The strong beer
gave him courage to laugh at the good-breeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>she had acquired in the ’Squire’s
kitchen, and even to mimick the fine
words Mrs. Betty, madam’s own maid,
used to bring out, when she condescended
to speak to the vermin; for she despised
low life, and never demeaned herself.
The old woman was half angry;
but, yet, she was glad to let us hear how
she had been honoured. And, conscious
she knew better than her husband, hoped
as how we would not be affronted, as
John had a honest heart, and meant not
to disparage any body, for all he was so
fond of joking.</p>

<p class='c006'>We then heard the chaise moving
slowly; we spoke to Harry, and desired
him to bring us another next morning,
and went to bed. The bed was hard,
yet I slept so soundly Dr. Bartlett had
some difficulty to wake me, when Harry
arrived.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>We took leave of John and his dame,
and the latter made her best curtsy,
though it was into the mud at the door
of the hut, when Dr. Bartlett gave them
a guinea, and I promised to send them a
side of bacon, and a few bottles of strong
beer, before Christmas.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will write soon again. Farewel.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I could not guess the reason why my
uncle sent in such a hurry for me. Now
you shall hear, and certainly I am very
fortunate. The day after I arrived, he
took hold of my hand, we were alone,
and pressing it, he said, I have observed
with pleasure your improvement,
Charles; you are the worthy son of a
good father, and I doubt not will render
his latter days happy—he deserves
it, for he has made mine comfortable,
I blush not to tell you, by teaching me
to conquer myself and practise virtue.
You have from your infancy been taught
more by example than precept, and
have not any inveterate bad habits to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>combat with.—Happy youth! shew your
gratitude to heaven for this inestimable
blessing; to you much has been given,
and much indeed is required. He
then presented me with a paper, and
added, I now give you my estate in
Hampshire, it is let out in small
farms, and produces about one thousand
pounds clear yearly rent; my life
draws nigh to a close, and I wished
to give you myself this testimony of
my esteem.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not know in what style I thanked
my uncle, I was so surprised; but I
am sure I felt grateful, and he must have
seen what I could not express.</p>

<p class='c006'>The whole family congratulated me,
and indeed paid me many compliments,
which I think I do not merit. If I
have spent my time in useful exercises,
did not my father render those exercises
pleasant? And if I have endeavoured to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>be good, I only followed an example I
admired. Believe me, William, all this
deserves no reward, I think I merely do
my duty: and if I did not I should be
unhappy. My pleasure in the pursuit
of science is necessary to keep me from
the listlessness of an idle life. Yes,
should some one say, Charles Grandison
does his duty, he is studious, he
honours his parents, he loves his fellow-creatures:
I should answer, I do
not know how all this has happened,
and why you wonder at it; I must do
so or lose the favour of God,—lose the
esteem of my parents, whom I love so
dearly; and as to my fellow-creatures,
I cannot help loving them, and doing
them good; it is not only the employment,
but the pleasure of my life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Bartlett writes to my father; I
doubt not but you will hear the letter
read. We are to return through London;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>I cannot lengthen out my letter,
though I have much to say, as I must
attend my uncle, he has just sent for
me. I can only then assure you that I
am yours affectionately.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>My friend Charles is returned, dear
mother; with what joy was he received.
The servants were all in the lobby to
wish him health and long life to enjoy
his estate; and the tenants gathered
about the gate, and uttered their good
wishes in a most audible roar. The
next day many of the neighbouring families
came to congratulate him. An
old gardener, who has lived thirty or
forty years in the family, and is allowed
to cultivate a little farm in the pleasure
grounds, came this morning, just after
some company had left us, leaning on
his crutch. Charles received him not
only with civility, but kindness; and
the venerable grey-headed man’s blessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>brought tears into his eyes. See if he
is not going to weep, said Edward, as
soon as the gardener’s back was turned;
would you not think, William, that he
received more pleasure from that old
man’s visit, than all the rest of the visitors
afforded him. You have just guessed it,
replied Charles; his simple earnest prayers
for my preservation seemed to come
from his heart, and they went much
nearer mine than all the fine compliments
I before heard dropped with a
cool tone of voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I must not forget to tell you, that
Charles, soon after his arrival, entreated
his father to take the estate for some
time into his own hands. I should be
very unhappy, my dear parent, to be
independent of you; receiving favours
from you, is the greatest pleasure of my
life—O do not deprive me of it! Sir
Charles appeared affected, and said, I
will manage it for you, my son, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>will together visit the different farms;
you shall enquire into all the family
concerns of your tenants, and become
the protector and friend of those who,
in some measure, are dependant on you.
You will then be able to judge of their
wants, and animate their industry.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are soon to return to London: I
shall not perhaps have an opportunity
of writing again before we set off, but
certainly will the day we reach town.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Last night, dear mother, we again
entered this great city; I should have
written as I promised, but I was too
late for the post, and I have a long story
to tell you.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poor Harry broke his leg while we
were on the road; a hack-horse threw
him, as he was turning suddenly to
open a gate. Charles ran to him, and
supported him in the carriage till we
arrived at a large town; soon after we
reached it, Sir Charles, who was in
another carriage with Lady Grandison,
Emilia, and Edward, overtook us, and
were instantly informed of the accident.
A surgeon was immediately sent for, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the bone set; but his leg was shattered
in such a dreadful manner, the surgeon
apprehends he will always be a cripple.
Sir Charles staid in the room while the
operation was performed, to support
Harry’s spirits.</p>

<p class='c006'>I forgot to mention, that Dr. Bartlett
was not with us, he did not return
to Grandison-Hall with Charles, he had
some business of his own to settle in
town. Charles and I had a hired chaise
to ourselves, and we, with Harry to attend
us, always rode first to provide a
good fire for Lady Grandison, who has
been for some time a little indisposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Charles never travels with much
state, Harry was the only servant we
had with us. On his own account he
did not care, he expected to sleep in his
own house that night; but he did not
like to leave a faithful servant, in his
present weak state, entirely to the care
of strangers. I will give you his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>words, for they made an impression
on me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Providence has placed men in different
situations, to facilitate the main
end of life, improvement in virtue; yet
distress brings us all on a level again,
we are then no longer master and servant,
but men; worldly distinctions are
forgot, and nature asserts her primitive
equality. I would not neglect paying
to the meanest of my fellow-creatures,
the attention I might need from them,
if I did, I should forfeit my own esteem.
Was Lady Grandison well, I would stay
this night to nurse Harry, and to-morrow
send him one of his fellow-servants.—Charles
eagerly caught his father’s
hand.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>O, my dear father, do you go with
my mother, and let me remain to represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>you, let me nurse Harry. I should
be happy to convince him, that I did
not sit up with the old officer, because
he was a gentleman, but because he was
a man.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This offer I expected from you, my
son, and do not want to be importuned
to grant your request. William shall
remain with you, and before to-morrow
night, I will send Robert to take your
place. With what delight do I perceive
that your heart opens itself to those true
pleasures which dignify and cultivate
the mind. Your kindness to Harry will
soften his bodily pain, and you will feel
yourself in what exercises your chief
happiness must consist.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Charles soon after left us, and we
went to sit in Harry’s room; as he was
fallen asleep, we each took a book, we
would not converse lest we should disturb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>him. Charles had enquired of his
mother, what kind of nourishment was
the most proper for the invalid, and
took care to order it to be ready, that
he might have some refreshment when
he awoke. We had some weak wine
and water, and a crust of bread; and in
the night the landlord brought us some
coffee.</p>

<p class='c006'>Harry would fain have persuaded us
to go to bed; but Charles resolutely
refused, and it was very happy we did
not, for the poor man was delirious,
and tried to get out of bed. And I believe
he would have torn the bandage off
his leg, if Charles, who was the only
person he recollected, had not entreated
him to let it alone. He obeyed him—did
I not say truly, it was happy we
were there? I could not help observing,
that while Charles was busy about him,
he did not seem to be afraid of any accident
which might have happened to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>himself. When Harry became composed,
I mentioned to him the remark I
had made, and owned I should have been
afraid to have held Harry, when he looked
so frantic. Hear his answer. When I
am doing what I think right, I never feel
any thing like fear—should I be killed
assisting a fellow-creature, would it not
be a glorious death? But I will tell you
when I have felt fear. Once or twice I
have been in danger in a crowd, into
which I entered to procure amusement
or gratify idle curiosity; then, indeed,
I was afraid, and I thought, if I now
lose my life, how can I answer to my
Creator for risking it. This single
thought deprived me of the courage you
admire: nothing terrifies me, when I
can pray to God, and am conscious I am
obeying his holy will.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall not soon forget this night, dear
mother; the stillness of it, and the sight
of Harry, who was perhaps on his deathbed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>made me think very seriously, and
I could not help praying to God, to
enable me so to live, that I might not
fear death. I used often to wish to be
rich, but in this sick chamber, these
wishes appeared foolish, I only desired
to be good. I felt the truth of Sir
Charles’s observation, that this was the
solid distinction between man and man;
I wondered I had not thought so before,
the virtuous only appeared great in my
eyes, because they can conquer death, and
do not dread the end of life. And Charles
agreed with me, that those who overcome
the sorest earthly evil, must certainly
be the truly great. We talked of
all the heroes we had read an account of
in history, and observed that few died
happily whose chief aim had not been
to benefit mankind, rather than obtain
a great name for themselves. But I
should tire you if I was to relate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>whole of our conversation, on subjects
we seldom talked of before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Towards morning Harry fell asleep,
and woke quite sensible; I was glad of
it, for it is a shocking thing to see a
man deprived of reason. How dependent
he is! I now recollect Dr. Bartlett’s
words, That it is the right use of
reason, which makes us independent of
every human being.</p>

<p class='c006'>We sat with Harry all day and endeavoured
to divert him; and he was diverted.
Robert came in the evening,
and brought a note from Sir Charles, in
which he desired us to sleep at the
inn that night, and set off for London
early in the morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>Come, said Charles, the sun is not
yet set, let us take a walk and look about
the town, while supper is preparing.
It is cold, replied I. Yes, answered
Charles, but let us not mind that.
There is nothing better at this season
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>than to be accustomed to rough weather,
and to harden ourselves against the winter.
You will see this winter, continued
he, how little I care for wind,
frost, rain, or snow. I never stay in
the house, I run through all weathers.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this moment we came to a small
cottage, where an old woman sat at a
spinning-wheel, she seemed to be very
poor. Let us go in and see her spin,
said Charles; and we entered, begging
the woman not to take it amiss, as we
did not wish to interrupt her, but to see
her spin. She began to talk to us, still
turning her wheel. You are very diligent,
said Charles. I must be so, replied
the old woman, for it is my only
support, except a trifle the gentry give
me, in the winter, to buy coals, for they
are very dear, and my hands are sometimes
so cold, I cannot turn my wheel.
Charles then asked, if her daily labour
was sufficient to procure her bread. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>answered yes, but it sometimes happens
in the winter, when I have fewel to buy,
that I have not money to purchase flax,
and then I must sit in the cold idle and
hungry. And is there nobody that will
lend you a trifle, cried Charles, when
you are in such extreme distress? Good
lack, said the old woman, I dare say
there are many good hearts in the world;
but the rich, who are tender-hearted,
sit in their warm parlours, and do not
see the hardships we poor folk undergo.
Charles then gave her a guinea and we
hurried out of the cottage, to avoid her
thanks; but her blessings followed us.</p>

<p class='c006'>While we were at supper, he enquired
of the landlord, if she was an industrious
woman; he assured us she was, and
patiently endured many hardships rather
than become burdensome to the parish.
Charles then desired him to supply her
with coals the ensuing winter; let her
turn her wheel glibly, and I will pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>you, good Sir, when I see you in the
spring.</p>

<p class='c006'>We visited Harry, and Charles desired
to be called, if he was very ill during the
night. Harry looked pleased; Ah! Sir,
said he, I find you care for a poor sick
servant, as well as for a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before we went to bed we could not
help talking of the old woman.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How happy it is for her that she can
work, and keep out of the work-house;
even in her old age her industry enables
her to be useful to society, and to command
a little abode of her own.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yet we slight such coarse hands;
where should we get linen, if there were
not industrious spinners?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That we do not think of, we are apt
to despise, as you observe, the useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>work of such coarse hands, which we
could not do without; and admire the
embroidery the ladies work merely for
ornament. And why? Because the soft
fingers of the ladies do their work in
elegant rooms, and the poor labour in
huts.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And yet, according to our reasoning
last night, the poor woman who works
to earn her bread, or clothe her children,
is a much more respectable member of
society, than the lady who employs herself
about work which can only procure
her praise.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Barren praise, my dear William, for
Dr. Bartlett has said, that it is very dangerous
to allow ourselves to be pleased
with any commendation, which is not
bestowed on our virtue. But I have
seen some ladies, who neglected their
children to prepare ornaments for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>persons. And when they had them on
they looked like dolls; I could not respect
them as I respect the old woman.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I will never complain of the cold again,
but rather encounter it, that I may be
put in mind of the distresses the poor
have to struggle with. Had you turned
back when I complained, this poor old
soul would have lost the comfortable fire
you have procured her this winter.</p>

<p class='c005'>We went to bed, slept soundly, and
set off in good spirits, after hearing from
Harry that he had passed a better night.
I will now conclude this long letter;
but first let me tell you, we are to visit
some manufactories soon, to learn to value
the labours of the poor, and the useful
employments of life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I mentioned to you that I expected
to see some manufactories; yesterday
Dr. Bartlett conducted us all, except
Edward, who is gone for a short time
to visit a relation, to several; and our
curiosity was fully satisfied. I had seen
some formerly, but without taking much
notice of them: I viewed them all as
something very common and rather
mean; the case is altered now, I am
taught to reason about them, and to admire
the goodness of God displayed in
the ingenuity of man. O, my dear mother,
how wonderful are the ways of
Providence! I must repeat an observation
of Dr. Bartlett’s before I relate a
conversation which passed between Emilia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Charles, and I, after we returned
home.</p>

<p class='c006'>The poor, said he, whilst they are
earning their own bread, provide necessaries
and superfluities for the rich; who,
in return, often to aggrandize themselves,
fight their battles, plan their laws, and
enable the mechanics to send their work
to foreign markets. The labourer also,
who tills the ground, and anxiously turns
the produce to a good account, that he
may be able to pay his rent, is protected
by the rich, and may reasonably expect
to solace himself after his toil, under
the shade of the trees his fathers
have planted, or those he himself has
reared. Thus does heaven bind us all
together, and make our mutual wants
the strong cement of society; and even
the follies of individuals are so overruled
as to produce good to the whole.
Well, now for our conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c006'>You do not complain, I hope, that
you have taken the trouble to accompany
us?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Complain, no, I should have been
very sorry to have missed so pleasing and
instructive a sight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I for my part, am very well pleased.
What skilful, laborious men there are
in the world; and how much of the
comfort of our lives, depends on the exertions
of our fellow-creatures; and must
arise from the labours of those poor uneducated
people, the rich are too apt to
despise.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, I have often seen that persons of
high rank treat them as if they were not
made of the same flesh and blood.—I
have seen that they scarcely moved their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>hats to a mechanic, though he bows
himself almost to the ground.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That appears to me to be very wrong.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is indeed a very perverse pride, for
with all their riches, they could not do
without those useful men. O, thought
I, when I saw the weaver, who sat sweating
before his loom, this man exhausts
his vigour to procure me a great comfort,
linen. Without him, the flax,
that valuable plant, which the earth
produces for this purpose, would be
useless. Every one will allow, that
shoe-makers and taylors are necessary; in
short, since I find that laborious people
are so essential to the well-being of the
world, I cannot imagine how men can
treat them with so much contempt. As
to myself I shall guard against such behaviour;
in the use of those things, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>shall endeavour always to remember the
men who are the instruments to convey
the blessings of heaven to me: and
these considerations will make me esteem
my fellow-members of society; and try
to fulfil my part of the sociable compact.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I agree with my friend, and am
ashamed that I should ever have looked
on this class of my brethren with indifference.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But I found nothing that excited my
wonder more than the art of printing.
How could it be possible to write so
many books as there are in the world?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That would not be possible. We
should then have very few books; and
all those great geniuses, from whose writings
we reap so much instruction, would
be to us as dead men,—now they live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and are our friends. Your country,
William, had the honour of giving birth
to the inventor of this invaluable art.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, and he has a statue erected to his
memory before the house where he lived.
His name was Laurence Koster.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You wonder much at the letter press;
but how many of the arts which we have
not seen, would afford you equal matter
for astonishment?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is almost incomprehensible, how a
common potter, out of a rough lump of
clay, should be able to make such a variety
of useful and ornamental things.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Have not these poor people reason to
complain that they work so hard for a
piece of bread?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By no means. They have even comparative
happiness. How disagreeable
must be the miners’ employment to
us, who have been brought up in a
different style of life, and have opened
our eyes to the beauties of nature? It is
laborious, and they lose their health
while they are secluded from the cheerful
sight of the sun, which enlivens
every other labour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They might let it alone, and do something
else to earn a livelihood.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And what then would become of us
all? They dig the gold out of the bowels
of the earth, of which we are so proud;
it is true we could do without it, as any
thing that would lie in a small compass,
might pass in exchange as money: but
iron we could not spare; we should do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>every thing in a very clumsy manner
without iron tools.—Only think of the
various comforts which accrue to society
from this one metal: and men must
procure it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is true.—And if we rightly consider
it, we may say with truth, that iron
is more valuable than gold.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is not only more valuable, but our
abode on the earth would be uncomfortable
without it:—it is apparently a necessary;
and the great instrument of
civilization.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We see greater respect paid to a goldsmith
than a common mechanic, though
the first we could do without.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps it is because that a goldsmith
gains greater profit, and goes better
clothed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You have well observed, Emilia. We
are very unreasonable when we are
proud of dress. Where should we get
the finery, if the hard hands of the diligent
labourer did not provide the materials?
A diamond is dug out of the earth
without our assistance. Silk stuff, prepared
by the industry of a worm, and
in which we pride ourselves, is worked
for us without our knowing how.—Yet,
we are delighted with the praise we receive,
as much as we could be had we
invented the arts, or manufactured the
product of the earth. We only wear
what the skill and industry of others
have procured for us.—What are we,
when we recollect such foolish pride?—We
who presume to arrogate merit to
ourselves, which belongs to others; to
the weavers and taylors—and even to the
worms that contribute to adorn us. But
you may say, such habits are a proof that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>we are rich, or born in a distinguished
rank.—It is nothing!—We are, as I
have just proved, indebted for the gold
and silver to the poor miners, who, at
the expence of health, dig it out of the
mine—and we possess it by mere chance.—And
our birth, of which we are apt
to boast so much, is equally accidental.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But we pay more respect to painters,
and all those who exercise the fine arts,
than we do to mechanics, though theirs
are not useful employments.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is, because we involuntarily pay
respect to an improved mind. Dr. Bartlett
has taught me to make distinctions.
Those employments, in which the mind
is exercised more than the body, tend
to cultivate the understanding, the noblest
kind of superiority. Those artists
afford food for the mind; pleasures that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the man has not any conception of who
is occupied in manual labour. We may
choose our companions and friends; but
all the labourers in the great field of
life, are our brothers; and equally deserve
the rights of humanity. And they
are superior to their fellow men who
are most extensively useful, not those
who, in false state, exhibit diamonds and
gold on their body, whilst their minds
are, perhaps, inferior to those of the poor
creatures, who, by a weak taper’s light,
dug them out of their hidden place, to
decorate folly, not ornament virtue; for
virtue has inherent splendor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dear mother, I will never exalt myself
on account of my birth again; but
I will try to gain the noblest distinction,
that of virtue. For with respect to understanding,
I have often seen the witty
applauded, when those you termed wise,
were scarcely observed.—What, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>this admiring the dazzling and neglecting
the useful? But, you say the generality
are superficial, and only attend to
the outside of things. I will try to remember,
that the praise of one sensible
person, is of more worth than the encomium
of a crowd; because they consider
before they speak.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Honest Harry is returned quite recovered,
that is, as well as he will ever
be; for the surgeon was right, he will
be a cripple all his life. Sir Charles
and his Lady are much concerned, for
he was a faithful servant, and has been
in the family some years. This morning
we had the following conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Harry’s accident makes me very uneasy.—Poor
fellow! he was so well-made—so
active.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We ought to draw useful lessons from
the misfortunes we deplore. You find
we are not a moment sure of ourselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>He rose in the morning alert, full of
health—before night, he was stretched
on a bed—helpless as a babe. A single
unforeseen accident, which we cannot
guard against, may in a moment deprive
us of our limbs, our sight, nay, even
of life itself. To him who lives conformable
to the laws of God, no death
is sudden or dreadful.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Accidents, you say, we cannot guard
against; but are there not many misfortunes
which we bring on ourselves
through imprudence?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An event of this kind, a fatal one,
happened last year in Holland. Two
boys were at play struggling together
with a pistol, they did not know it was
loaded, the pistol went off, and one of
them was killed, and the other so shocked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>that he has walked about the fields
melancholy ever since.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That misfortune was entirely their
own fault. It should always be a fixed
rule with boys never to play with firearms;
for in every thing that depends
on ourselves we ought to be circumspect,
and to be careful of our own lives, and
of the lives of others, as a loan, which
we must return at the time it pleases the
Almighty to demand it—we must return
our talents improved, or fearfully
wait for the punishment denounced
against the unfaithful servant.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Are not they equally wrong who venture
their lives on the ice, before the
frost is quite set in, only for the pleasure
of skaiting a few days sooner?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The passion for pleasure so blinds
them, that they think not of the danger.
It is then wrong to indulge ourselves
in all that we desire, for when this
propensity to present pleasure is master
of us, it dispossesses our judgment of
its rightful place in the mind, and the
quiet suggestions, reflection would obtrude,
are not heard in the tumult.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But, Sir, what is Harry to do? He
is not now capable of service.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c006'>Speak, tell us your opinion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You gave a yearly income to our old
gardener because he had been a faithful
servant.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Very true; but the gardener was a
decrepid old man, worn out in the service
of my family; he could not do any
thing to earn a livelihood. I respect old
age, I would not grub up a tree which
had long afforded me a shade; and the
horse I rode on, when I was young, has
now a meadow to range in, and a soft
bed to stretch those limbs on, which
were formerly active in my service.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I would readily save my pocket-money,
and give up the new clothes I have
been promised, to contribute to support
poor Harry.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are a good girl; what you have
said adorns your face, and makes you
appear much more lovely than the finest
ornaments could. But, Charles, let me
hear what you would advise?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I am afraid to give you advice, you
know every thing so much better than
I do.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>LADY GRANDISON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That is very well observed; but your
father asks, not to be informed what is
proper to be done, but to hear your sentiments.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I respect Harry, nay love him; though
not as I love my dear father, and I would
fain serve him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Go on, Charles.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>His father was a good shoe-maker,
and worked hard to bring up a large family;
he brought Harry up a shoe-maker;
but Harry had a mind to see the
world, as he told me, when he was sick,
and he left his father, he was then very
sorry for it. His father died since he
has been in your service, and he has
constantly sent most part of his wages to
his poor mother.—Now if you would
have the goodness to give him a little
furniture, and leather and tools, he and
his mother might live together, and they
would both be provided for; and, in
time, he might be able to return you the
money, for he has an honest heart.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What, without interest, Charles?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now, Sir, you joke with me—but I
perceive why.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>LADY GRANDISON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Because you were so very careful, and
would have the money returned.</p>

<p class='c005'>Charles kissed his mother’s cheek, and
said, forgive me, I see you will do more
for him, than I could presume to ask.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, I am glad that your sentiments
so well accord with mine. We do the
poor an essential service when we put
them in a way to earn their own subsistence;
for then we support the body
without injuring the mind. Idleness in
every station leads to vice. Do you go
and speak to Harry, and ask him how
much will be requisite for this purpose,
and then we will give him it as a reward
for his fidelity, and to comfort
him under his misfortune.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dear parents, I thank you; I will run
immediately and tell him the good news.
It will rejoice his heart, for when he
was sick and delirious, he raved about
his mother, and repented, sorely repented
that he had not followed her advice
and worked at his own trade. He will
be so glad to maintain his mother, for
the poor old woman, after bringing up
a family, finds it hard to stand at the
wash-tub.—He was going—</p>

<p class='c006'>Stop a moment, I must go with you,
for I love to see people happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>O, my dear mother, how delightful
it is to have it in our power to be bountiful.
The poor man cried for joy, when
Charles informed him what his parents
designed to do for him. Thus God provides
for those who behave well to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>parents. He saved to assist an old mother,
and now he is lame his master takes
care of him. In this way, said Sir Charles,
we ought to lighten the afflictions we are
liable to, and must humbly endure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Edward is come again this afternoon,
and looks very well. He informed
us of a disagreeable accident which
happened lately, and shows very clearly
how imprudent it is to talk idly, and
merely for the sake of having something
to say, to canvass the faults or even the
vices of others. But I will give you the
particulars of a conversation we had in
consequence of this information.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You knew Colonel Brown, Charles.
Last week Captain Fiery shot him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And for what reason?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Because his son, in a large company,
spoke very disrespectfully of the Captain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and said he was a man whose word could
not be depended on.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Suppose it was so, it was not proper
to speak of it, especially in a large company;
these kind of conversations proceed
oftener from folly than from a detestation
of vice, or a nice sense of
honour, which makes a person feel indignation,
when any of his fellow-creatures
act meanly.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How could the Colonel be answerable
for what his son said?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fiery is a hot-headed foolish man, and
because he could not have satisfaction
from a youth, demanded it of the father.
He apologized for his son’s imprudence;
but Fiery would not listen to
reason, he compelled the other to meet
him, his profession did not allow him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>to refuse a challenge; he was killed on
the spot, and Fiery sat off directly for
France.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And what will he get by the name of
courage, which his rash insensibility
may have procured him? He must never
return to his native country, his
hands have been dyed in the blood of
his fellow-creature, he has robbed a family
of its support, and in consequence
of his violating the laws of humanity,
is compelled to wander in a strange country,
and only to receive that attention
his money will procure.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But young Brown, how I pity him!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes, he deserves pity; he is continually
upbraiding himself with his folly,
and lamenting his rashness, his want of
consideration, which has deprived his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>mother of all her comfort, and himself
of a tender friend and affectionate father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c006'>Yet, many think him not to blame, he
only spoke the truth. Captain Fiery’s
character is generally known, and he is
as generally despised.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Believe me, brother, we are not always
to say what is true, when it
tends to the prejudice of another
we must be silent; it is more to our
credit to soften the faults we must mention,
and better still, perhaps, not to
mention them at all. Dr. Bartlett has
often told me, that those who accustom
themselves to tell all they know of others,
will imperceptibly deviate from truth,
and, forgetting compassion, will become
unjust.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I agree with you, and think it possible
that those who build their virtues on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the vices of others, will soon have only
comparative virtue.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is chiefly to tell some news, or to
appear of consequence, that people retail
scandalous anecdotes; yet, those who
listen to such stories with malignant pleasure,
despise and fear the slanderer; though
murder should not happen, many disagreeable
consequences may follow, and
we should never mention the faults of
others without a chance of reclaiming
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The conversation was interrupted, and
so I must bid you adieu.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Last Friday we all of us went to
pay a visit where there was a large party
of young people, and some of them of
the first rank. After we came home we
conversed about them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What think you, Charles, of the various
dresses you saw? Young Owen’s
shabby coat appeared very conspicuous
near Sir William Turner’s elegant
fashionable suit.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Young Owen is not rich, but I am
sure that he in his plain dress commands
more respect than Sir William, if we go
into company to be amused and improved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and not to see a block on which fine
clothes are hung.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You make me laugh, Charles; so,
those who take so much pains to adorn
their persons are, in your opinion, mere
blocks.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I do not absolutely say so, but this I
am certain of, that those who are as accomplished
and entertaining as young
Owen, ought to take place of him,
whose rank, fortune, and appearance are
his only claim to notice.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lady Jane L—— was of a different
opinion; she said, she should certainly
have staid at home, had she guessed
that Owen would have been there, for
she could not bear to sit in company
with a youth whose grandfather was a
mean mechanic.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Many persons of quality are of the
same opinion, but I have been told that
we ought always to prefer merit to birth
and riches; the former is the fruit of our
own labour, but the latter is merely
accidental.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But it seems a rule in life to seek rather
the company of superiors than inferiors.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To seek either to associate with superiors
or inferiors constantly, would, in
my opinion, be equally mean, equally
tend to debase the soul; friendship requires
equality.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lady Jane, whom Emilia was speaking
of, appears to me very ill-natured.
Did you not observe how she ridiculed
that modest young gentleman who was
a little deformed?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Yes; she called him a spider, a little
ape, and spoke so loud, that he heard
her and appeared disconcerted, and yet
she continued to laugh.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lady Jane did not recollect, that though
her title announced her rank, her behaviour
proved she was not well-bred. She
had not sense to discover, that intolerable
pride is a great fault, and deformity
only a misfortune. She did not recollect,
that it is her Creator she was blaming,
and that a single fall, or some other
casualty, might soon render her an object
of ridicule; and, at any rate, time
quickly flies, and will insensibly destroy
those charms she is now so proud of;
and the ignorant may in their turn laugh
at her, when she appears old and ugly,
without wisdom or virtue to render gray
hairs respectable. How often have I
heard my tutor say, that wisdom and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>virtue never grow old, on the contrary,
while they are useful to mankind, they
spread a real splendor over the character
of an individual.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dear mother, how often have you
warned me against such behaviour, and
how tenderly have I seen you treat those
whom others despised? Farewel.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Forgive me, dear mother, for having
been so long silent, but I have only
disagreeable tidings to communicate to
you. We all wear a face of woe; my
worthy benefactor, our dear Sir Charles,
is very ill, and has been so for some
time. The physicians think him in great
danger, and we expect nothing but death.
Lady Grandison, as you may well imagine,
is almost inconsolable. Emilia is
continually weeping, and Edward appears
almost distracted. I will give you
an account of a conversation we had yesterday,
after we left the sick room. Edward
clasped his hands together as in
despair, and threw himself into a chair
in an adjoining chamber. Ah! William,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>he cried, how it grieves me to think I
have so often offended my more than father;
yes, my friend, every thing I have
done now haunts me, and pains my very
soul.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My dear Edward be comforted, he is
still alive, and God may perhaps restore
him to health.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I know I do not deserve that favour,
I have so often offended him, and though
he has forgiven me, I can never forgive
myself; and, perhaps, God will not
forgive me. Happy Charles, who now,
because he has always been dutiful, can
look for his father’s death with a sedate
sorrow, while I fly from his sick bed,
continually tormented by fear and remorse.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Indeed he appears to have much fortitude.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He has a Father in heaven that is good
to him, who gives him power to support
his grief.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Pray you also to that Father, and you
too will obtain his favour; the unhappy
who sincerely turn to him, will always
find him compassionate and ready to forgive
those who really lament their faults,
not merely the consequences produced
by them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Well then, I will do so; but oh!
William, my heart is very heavy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dear mother, I pity poor Edward,
but I admire Charles; and I do not know
which to praise most, his filial love, or
his sedateness and patience; in the bitterness
of his grief he scarcely ever leaves
his sick parent, he gives him his medicines,
stifles his sighs, and hides his tears,
and almost seems afraid to breathe when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>his father closes his eyes; but I have
seen him fold his hands together, and,
lifting up his eyes to heaven, pray with
ardour. I will not send this letter off
till to-morrow, when I will write again.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='fss'>WILLIAM</span>, <i>in continuation</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>How much I was affected yesterday
afternoon. I went, after I had done
writing, to Sir Charles’s chamber, I
opened the door softly, but instead of
Charles, saw Lady Grandison and Emilia,
both kneeling at the bed-side; I stole
away unperceived to seek for Charles, I
could not find him in any of the chambers,
no one knew where he was. Oh!
said I to myself, where is my dear
Charles? I ran into the garden, and there
I found him in the summer-house; he
was kneeling down, his hands and eyes
were lifted up to heaven, and big tears
rolled down his cheeks; I heard him
pray with earnestness, but could only
distinguish a few words.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span><i>Preserve, oh! my God, my dear, my
affectionate father—grant him longer life,
Thou knowest best, Thou art infinitely merciful,
oh! pardon me, I wish to die to
save him, to save my mother from the anguish
she must endure if deprived of him.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>He seemed in an agony, and at length
arose with more apparent firmness; I
could no longer be silent, I caught his
hand, God will preserve your father, I
exclaimed; I hope so, answered he, but
let us walk round the garden, that my
mother may not see that I have been
crying, it would add to her sorrows.
We walked backwards and forwards,
when Charles resumed the discourse;
You heard me pray then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No, I only heard a few incoherent
words, and that you wished to die, to
save your father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Of how much more consequence is
his life than mine? I scarcely know how
I should live without him. My wish
was a selfish one, for perfect happiness
is not to be found on earth; I have
heard him often say, the happiest have
their troubles, and the best their failings,
which disturb their earthly peace.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What a comfort would these sensible
reflections afford, should you lose your
father?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I hope they would; though it now
appears to me, that nothing could afford
me comfort, should I be deprived of the
best of fathers. Come, let us go in; I
would not lose the few moments that
still afford me an opportunity of shewing
my affection and alleviating his sufferings.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>We went immediately into the house.
Sir Charles had slept near an hour, and
was something better; he called Charles
with a faint, yet a distinct voice, as soon
as he heard him enter the room; he approached
the bed and threw himself upon
his knees, he took hold of his father’s
hand and kissed it several times
with a kind of eager respect; what sensibility,
what sincerity and grief, did I
not see in his countenance! The tears
were rolling fast down his cheeks, it
would be impossible to delineate the
scene.—What does my father want?
asked he; what would he say to his son?
I wish, answered Sir Charles, to tell you,
that your duty and affection will soften
the pangs of death, your mother will
still have a friend, your sister a protector,
and your past behaviour makes me
rely on your future. You weep, grieve
not my son, sometime or other we must
have been separated, but if you obey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>your heavenly father we shall meet again,
where death has no dominion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But, my dear father, if you recover
now, I might die before you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Would you then, Charles, rather have
me suffer, than endure grief yourself?
Do you love me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do I love you!—I love you more than
I love myself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No, my dear, you are mistaken; you
love yourself better, or you would not
wish me to live in a world where there
are so many cares and sorrows.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is true, but I pray forgive me, I
cannot help wishing to keep you here.
I cannot forbear thinking how unhappy
I shall be, when I lose my father; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>have such need of your wise counsel, you
are the guide of my youth,—my first
friend.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You will still have a good mother,
and you have a Father in heaven, who
will never leave you nor forsake you;
reconcile your mind to the event: if I
die, recollect that I am only gone a little
while before you; be virtuous, remember
your Creator, fulfil all your duties
to your fellow-creatures, and you will
without fear wait for the last solemn
hour, and the moment when we shall
meet again.—But I have said sufficient,
submit yourself to the Ruler of the universe,
who loves you even better than
I do.</p>

<p class='c005'>My friend Charles rose up, and retired
from the bed, without being able
to speak, his heart was full, he threw
himself into a chair. My father, said he,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>has commanded me to submit to the will
of heaven; this affecting command is,
perhaps, the last I shall ever receive from
his dear mouth.—Well then, I must, I
will be resigned. I will suppress my
grief as well as I can, and wait the event
with fortitude; my father has taught
me how to live, and I shall now learn
of him how to die; by imitating his
virtues, I may be thought worthy to
dwell with him in heaven, to meet him
never to part again.</p>

<p class='c006'>The physician came in with Dr. Bartlett,
he found his patient much better,
and gave us some hopes; the good Doctor
took Charles by the hand, and advised
him to take some rest, for he had
not been in bed these three nights: but
Charles begged to be excused; I cannot
sleep, Sir, said he, while my father suffers
so much. No, I slumber by his
bed when he rests, that is sufficient.
Indeed, who can so well take care of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>father as his own son? Who can love
him as well as I do? My eye must see
if he lies down soft and easy, I must
cover him, I must warm his dear hands
in mine when I find them cold.—I must
do more—I must receive his last breath.—He
could not go on, and when they
still continued to press him, he said, he
esteemed too much the few precious
hours he could now spend with his father
to lose one, while there was a
shadow of danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>What a son, dear mother! but even
the recital has affected me so much, I
can only assure you that I am your
dutiful son,</p>

<p class='c005'>I was very much concerned when I
heard of your benefactor’s alarming illness;
but I would fain hope, with you,
my dear William, that heaven will restore
so good a man, whose example the
world has so much need of. Yet, my
son, what an opportunity presents itself
for you to view death without terror.
You see with what peace and tranquility
a Christian can wait for his dying hour;
one who has observed the duties of
christianity, and not assumed the mere
name. You behold the good Sir Charles
resigned to the will of heaven, calmly
waiting for his dissolution; yes, every
one who has lived well, may be termed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>the friend of God, and secure of his protection
at the last trying hour, may view
it without dismay. He knows, that released
from all the cares and sufferings
of this life, he is going to enjoy the presence
and favour of the supreme fountain
of good, whose favorite he is, because
he has endeavoured to copy the
perfections, as far as he could discover
them, of that Being he adored. Death
has nothing terrible in it for him; no,
death, at that moment, appears his best
friend, as it conducts him to an eternity
of happiness, which, even in
this world, he has had a foretaste
of; and besides, what delight may not
a further improvement in knowledge
afford to one who has already advanced a
few steps in the attainment of it. Life
is like a dream, which quickly passes
away, and virtue only forces it to leave
lasting traces behind. Let us, my son,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>endeavour to be good, and then we
may all expect to meet where our great
improvement in virtue may ensure our
happiness. Neglect not to inform me,
by the first packet, of the present state
of health of our much-esteemed friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rejoice with us, my dear mother,
Sir Charles is now entirely out of danger;
I omitted writing for some days,
that I might be quite certain that our
hopes were well-founded. Our mourning
is now turned into joy: I think we
were never so happy before. But what
should I have done had he died? the
time of my departure for Holland approaches,
how could I have left my
friend in the midst of his grief? It is in
the hour of sorrow that we most need a
friend, and I think I love him better
than ever, since I saw him so unhappy;—but
it is all over now, and I shall return
with satisfaction to my dear mother
and sister. How quickly has this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>year flown away; and Dr. Bartlett has
frequently told me, that few complain
of the irksomeness of time, who are properly
employed. Certainly none are more
to be pitied than those who are habitually
idle; how far otherwise is it with
those happy families where useful employments,
and innocent amusements,
fill the whole day. I have learned of
Charles to divide my hours well, and I
shall do so, with your permission, when
I return home. I shall not then, I hope,
be any more dull, as I used formerly to
be, when we were without company;
nor shall I wish continually for the company
of young Du Lis, because he was
always merry. I will read to you, when
we are alone; and improve myself in
drawing, and in the many other things
I have been taught since I came to England,
that my friend Charles may not
blush for me, when we meet again. I
shall never forget what I heard Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Charles say a few days ago to Edward;
you wish much for company, dear Edward,
said he, but, believe me, it is
wishing for slavery. He who is always
running into company, cannot bear himself
in solitude; constant company leads
to habitual idleness. Society is agreeable;
but it must be relieved by retired
hours to remain long so. And it is very
improper, for young people especially,
every day to think of visiting; the days
of youth are invaluable, it is the seedtime
of life, and a harvest cannot be expected
when it has been neglected. You
ought then to suppress that desire of
continual dissipation, which insensibly
draws off the attention from more rational
pursuits, and even prevents young
people from obtaining a respectable situation
in the society they frequent. If
you would learn to be qualified for general
conversation, learn to think when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>you read, and through the assistance of
rational books, many hours of retirement
may pass pleasantly away, without
your wishing for the noise of society—Books
are never failing friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>How happens it, dear mother, that I
am so low-spirited when I am returning
to you whom I have so continually longed
to see? I love Sir Charles and his
Lady, and I love my friend as myself,
yet, I love you better than all the world.
I know not well what I feel, I would
willingly return, and still wish to remain
where I am. Sir Charles has given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>me reason to hope that I shall see my
friend in Holland much sooner than I
expected, and that we shall correspond
constantly during our separation; he then
gave me some books and mathematical
instruments. How much I shall have
to read to you, and how many things to
tell you, when I am once more returned
home!</p>

<p class='c006'>Farewel, farewel, will you forgive me
for feeling so much concern at leaving
my friends, when I am returning to the
most indulgent of parents, and a sister
whom I desire to improve? Soon, very
soon, shall I tell you, that I am your
very affectionate son,</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
